## Challenges in care
1. Challenges to care on a personal level
2. Challenges building a caring LG

> 
> I wish people are closer
> 
-  Because when people are close, more things can happen
-  They can spur each other on

## Part 1: Why should we care
### Why care as individuals and as a community
#### 1. We care because **God is love**
>1 John 4:7, 10, 16  
**7** Dear friends, let us love one another, *for love comes from God*. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God.
- God's love as the origin of human fraternity

> **10** This is love: not that we loved God, but that *he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.*
- God's love is demonstrated through the sacrificial love exhibited in the Passion

> **16** And *so we know and rely on the love God has for us*. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them.
- Loving one another is therefore a response and evidence to an overflow of divine love.

##### The disheartening parts
1. Flat battery - People who feel draining to keep up with
2. Stone wall - No response
3. Hedgehod - Hurts to care

#### 2. The church is called to be a community that loves and care
>John 13:34-35  
**34** “A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. 35By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.”
- The love between disciples are evidential as a mark of His people

> Acts 2:44-47  
**44** All the believers were together and had everything in common. **45** They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need. **46** Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, **47** praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people.

Calean's conversation to her colleague: Her colleague asks her "why do you go to church?"

Calean: "You know, church isn't just some place that I sit and listen to the pastor." She goes there to learn and leaves changed.

"That was the first time church was something desirable for him, and not just some religious obligation", says Calean

### The vision that a caring group leads to
#### 3. A caring LG reveals God's love for His people
This point and the next alludes more to a vision instead. 

###### James' sharing:
- Due to Zoom fatigue, sharings were lackluster. Afer listening to them, his response was to care for each of his members personally week after week, meeting out for meals individually, but this wasn't sustainable
- He then found support in his coreteam, and they helped set up a Timetree - an app to track people's big struggles like tests, submissions etc, to bless people more personally and intentionally

Learning points:
- Know your people and take note of their unique needs
- Know their love language and start caring for them in the way they should be cared for
- Do it as a team

Example: setting up exam HQ, even if it's less conducive to study there, and showing up to study/ suffer together

###### Sharing: Calean's LG mate who got into an accident
A car crashed into her after veering off the road. Her friends set up a Facebook group (this was a while ago) to plan visits, pray, share updates on her condition and her family's needs etc during the hospitalisation process

After the incident she struggled to cope with the trauma, but the caring did not stop after she left the ICU. Her parents were more softened towards the church community after witnessing the care the LG dispenses

#### 4. A caring LG is a safe space for growth in godliness
Last week's sermon: God & Money
> Care in the community is a necessary part of encouraging people to share riskier or 'silly sounding' questions

Her LG shared about bad experiences regarding money: skepticism towards tithing, parents being cheated of their money etc. The culture of care allows questions and risky thought to be shared.


## How to care: practical ways
This is required for the sharper edges of discipleship: corrections, rebuke, healthy questions etc

### Stages of a LG
1. Formation
	- This is when the group first come together. 
	-  They want to know
		- what kind of group this is, 
		- where the group is headed to,
		- who they are in the group
	-  This is the part where creating memories is crucial
2. Spiritualisation
	- If stage 1 explains why they came, stage 2 explains why they stay
	- They find out
		1. Spiritual values
		2. Intimacy with the Word
		3. Corporate engagement with learning about God
3. Service
	-  Know their passions
	-  Empower them to serve
4. Growth
	-  The harvest part!
5. Discipleship
	-   More actively contributing members than otherwise
	-  Affirm people, empower, disciple 

### 4S for creating care
> Care culture exists throughout all stages, it is not exclusive to any of the 5 stages

#### *S*eek
-   Pray and ask God to reveal to you areas of the LG to grow in.
-   Observe the LG
	- E.g., How are the people interacting with each other? How is the overall energy of the LG?
-  Engage with your LG members/coreteam  
	- Find out if your observations tallies with them.. Or any other blindspots you may have missed out.

#### *S*tate
 

2. Spirit (What?)

After which, you want to be able to articulate both that conviction and direction in a clear, concise and consistent manner.
-   Clarity - is the essence of the culture I am trying to build clear and understandable to me and others?
-   Concise - are the cultural values easy to remember and articulate?
-   Consistent - are there frequent reminders and communication of the spirit behind the culture?
    
    What are the available platforms and opportune times to do so?
#### *S*ystem
We need to brainstorm various ways or systems, to help create and sustain the kind of culture we want to build.
Examples:
- Weekly angel mortal
- Bible study LG plan
- Fixed sharing groups for a month
- Fun LG day once a month
- Assign one person in the LG to plan for post-service dinner and activity
- 2 group chats- WA (Admin), Tele (Sharing)

 
#### *S*tructure
- Know who are the key players in the LG I can mobilize
- What are they good at
- What are the burdens on their heart
- What are the weaknesses that they are working on
