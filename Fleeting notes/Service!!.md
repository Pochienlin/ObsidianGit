- When we put someone in the hot seat, it's usually that they're important
	- Who do you see Jesus to be?
	- How does this knowledge affect the way I live?

##### Last week recap:
- The Jewish tradition and the Messianic breadcrumb trail
- All these breadcrumb points to Jesus as the Messiah
- For us: as we explore the Bible, let God have the authority to be God
	- Obedience and renewal, align to Him daily more and more

### John 6
**53** Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúVery truly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. **54** Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day. **55** For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. **56** Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them. **57** Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me. **58** This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your ancestors ate manna and died, but whoever feeds on this bread will live forever.‚Äù **59** He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.

**Many Disciples Desert Jesus**

**60** On hearing it, many of his disciples said, ‚ÄúThis is a hard teaching. Who can accept it?‚Äù **61** Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúDoes this offend you? **62** Then what if you see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before! **63** The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you‚Äîthey are full of the Spirit [e](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+6&version=NIV#fen-NIV-26321e "See footnote e") and life. **64** Yet there are some of you who do not believe.‚Äù For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him.
#### Background:
- Jesus was teaching people that He is the Messiah, and only through Him will they have eternal life
##### What were the people's reactions?

### John 7:14-30
#### Jesus Teaches at the Festival

**14** Not until halfway through the festival did Jesus go up to the temple courts and begin to teach. **15** The Jews there were amazed and asked, ‚ÄúHow did this man get such learning without having been taught?‚Äù
**16** Jesus answered, ‚ÄúMy teaching is not my own. It comes from the one who sent me. **17** Anyone who chooses to do the will of God will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own. **18** Whoever speaks on their own does so to gain personal glory, but he who seeks the glory of the one who sent him is a man of truth; there is nothing false about him. **19** Has not Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps the law. Why are you trying to kill me?‚Äù
**20** ‚ÄúYou are demon-possessed,‚Äù the crowd answered. ‚ÄúWho is trying to kill you?‚Äù
**21** Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúI did one miracle, and you are all amazed. **22** Yet, because Moses gave you circumcision (though actually it did not come from Moses, but from the patriarchs), you circumcise a boy on the Sabbath. **23** Now if a boy can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, why are you angry with me for healing a man‚Äôs whole body on the Sabbath? **24** Stop judging by mere appearances, but instead judge correctly.‚Äù

#### Division Over Who Jesus Is

**25** At that point some of the people of Jerusalem began to ask, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this the man they are trying to kill? **26** Here he is, speaking publicly, and they are not saying a word to him. Have the authorities really concluded that he is the Messiah? **27** But we know where this man is from; when the Messiah comes, no one will know where he is from.‚Äù

**28** Then Jesus, still teaching in the temple courts, cried out, ‚ÄúYes, you know me, and you know where I am from. I am not here on my own authority, but he who sent me is true. You do not know him, **29** but I know him because I am from him and he sent me.‚Äù

**30** At this they tried to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come. **31** Still, many in the crowd believed in him. They said, ‚ÄúWhen the Messiah comes, will he perform more signs than this man?‚Äù

### What were the different type of responses to Jesus in these 2 passages?
1. People who stood with Jesus
	1. There were some who readily believed in him
	2. Even some professed to believing in Him, though others mocked 
2. People who stood against Jesus
	1. "The teaching is too difficult"
	2. Authorities who rejected Him outright
3. People on the Fence
	1. Fascinated about the teachings of Jesus
	2. Waited and see, but did not put their stake in either side

#### Where did you stand when you first met Him? What about now?
- You will face persecution and resistance as you stand with Him

## Those who stand with Jesus

### The church as a beautiful mess
- People will step on each other's toes, even as we all strive to pursue the same God
- We will be hurt by the people we are serving (with), yet we ought to speak kindly and think well of them 
### When the trouble comes, will you stay?

## Those who are on the fence
### Using our understanding of the truth 
- When we are mete with contrary views on truth, how should we respond?
- How do we know when to give way and who to align towards?
