# How do I view your notes?
You can download [Obsidian md](https://obsidian.md/) or any other markdown browsers to view the contents

Currently the navigation is yet to be set: I did not want the notes to be heirarchical, hence the overwhelming amount of notes

If you are my coursemate and want to view my notes, go to Po -> find the module name. The course outline with the relevant notes inside should be linked.

For now the more likely things you are here for are
1. [[Enterprise Solution Management]]
2. [[Enterprise Solution Development]]

## There are some issues with viewing. What should I do?
If your `ad-note` or similar code blocks are not working, add the plugin for Obsidian Admonition.
Go to `Settings > Community Plugins > Browse > `and enter `Admonition` into the search bar to download. If you cannot access the community plugins, remember to turn your safe mode off. Also, remember to enable the plugin after the download for it to take effect.
