# According to Richard Ashcraft, what is wrong with a purely philosophical (i.e. abstract) conception of political theory? Why should we instead conceive political theory as political ideology?

# What is wrong with a purely abstract conception

## What is a purely abstract conception like?

- Focus on precise definitions, relations among concepts, the formulation of abstract models or general rules, adherence to the principle of logical consistency, the search for universal conditions, etc.

- It is a search for the **knowledge of principles that are 'universally applicable to all men at all times'**
    - 'timeless truths' or the 'perennial problems' of human existence
    - As such, abstraction, further removed from the realities of the thinker's time, is more heavily favoured

## Epistemological issue: Dominance of philosophy in political theory

Logical consistency as the benchmark for epistemology

- Hobbes and Hegel rate more logical → more highly rated
- Locke, Mill and Rousseau receive relatively low scores $\because$ logical contradictions, ambiguities and confused thinking
- Interpreters of pol theory view their role as a historic mission to straighten out the logical muddles of the old masters to tell us what they would have meant had they been *good* philosophers.

Ashcraft then asserts that these are what political theory can be, favouring the latter:

1. descriptive accounts of what some people have said or written
2. operational code which structures what most people do when they teach or write about political theory

## Implication of philosophical dominance

1. Removes the historical and social context in which the thinking resides
    1. some interpreters recognise the historical-social context does have a bearing upon understanding the political theory in question. 
        
        > "politcal philosophy is not a historical discipline"
        "fundamental distinction between philosophic and historical questions"
        > 
        1. However, it is not a guiding principle of their practice, nor does it structure their conception of political theory. 
        2. transcendent, universal truths are being sought — justifying how they can disavow the importance of historical information.
    2. Ashcraft believes if political theory isn't seen as historical, it also cannot be political
        
        > "To do so would involve nothing less than a 'wholesale transformation of political philosophy' and of our way of viewing the tradition of political theory" — Sheldon Wolin
        > 
        
        pol theory can and has in the past served as a weapon or guide to **practical** action in the hands of a political group, party, or class, this remains a mere formality.
        
    
    Removing the political background to the theory, we wouldn't be able to understand its objectives
    

## Understating political theory as an ideology

Ashcraft argues that the philosophical interpreter's view that **ideology is an emotive,** **non rational phenomenon** causes us to ignore important questions worth asking. 

- Interpreters maintain it is those deeply rooted in the political controversies governing their historical situations whose writings are characterised as **examples of political ideology.**
- They are then regarded as "lesser writers" of political theory, the partisans and combatants in the political struggles of their age.
    - Their views are seen as "more representative" of their age and society than are the great political philosophers whose theories transcend both the partisan conflict and the historical period. They argue that their theories can only be understood in terms of the specific social problems to which they are addressed.
    - provide a different and little utilised perspective to interpret the 'great' pol theories of the past,
    - presuppositions, arguments, and theoretical problems attached to this approach to political theory have a recognisable and significant political importance within contemporary society.
        - For example, what was Mill trying to accomplish by theorising with respect to the realisation of political changes in his society? What might we learn, from approaching pol theory in this manner, about the relationship between intellectuals and the working class, or about their respective roles in effecting social and political change?
- By directing attention towards the relationship between political theorising and the political objectives of parties or classes within society, the "self-reflective" aspects of this approach would force the theorist or interpreter to raise these questions with respect to his or her presentation of political theory.

In addition, there is a very thin line between that separates the **political theorist** from the **ideologist**. 

- How would one distinguish between a political ideology from one that 'cuts through the ideological prisms' and can thus be called 'theorists'?
- Ashcraft argues that **perhaps pol theory has historically functioned as ideology, and that the great pol philosophers exhibit some of the qualities of ideologues**. In spite of this, there is an unyielding insistence upon an analytical distinction between pol theory and ideology in literature
    - This distinction is 'as sharply drawn and as **little defended** as the one separating pol theory and history'.

## Pol Theory as Philosophy

### Pros

**Strauss:** 

1. The **politicisation** (weaponisation) of philosophy —> **Decline** of political theory —> political philosophy has become ideology.
2. **Historicism** as a prevalent attitude amongst contemporary interpreters of political theory —> Political Philosophy has been r**eplaced by the history of political theory** + **Absence of 'great' political philosophy** in the 20th century —> Our age is ruled by '**minor' political theorists** preoccupied with grasping their own historical situations and engaged in political struggles in which political thinking is dominated by contending ideologies.

**Wolin:**

1. **Society has replaced the political** and political philosophy has been eclipsed by other forms of knowledge
2.  Historical emergence of liberalism as a perspective —> It has structured our conception of politics around the primacy of economic interests —> **Political theory is usurped by economic theory** —> Society becomes the predominant influence, not political order.

→ Present pol theory is traceable to the **subordination of philosophic" concerns to the political and economic interests** of those groups or classes which supported the development of liberalism as a political theory.

### Cons

**Ashcraft counter-argument**: **2 failures** of people like Strauss and Wolin who take this stance

1. They have yet to question the 'basic economic presuppositions of liberalism' that they argue has replaced political thinking.
2. They have not said how we can **overthrow** or **displace** the interests, classes, parties and presuppositions which 'structure the modern decline of or departure from the tradition of pol philosophy'. 

paradox we will face when uncovering the basis for the systematic neglect of the 'problem of ideology'. 

- It is the underlying tacit assumption that political theory has 'declined' to the level of ideology, which forms a vital part of the argument that it *should* be as philosophy.
- The basic social/historical conditions which structure the practice of contemporary political theorists are recognised, yet they do not serve as a conscious guideline for teaching and writing of pol theory.
- **Instead, pol theory is taught and written *as if* it were a great philosophy rather than ideology** - despite them knowing that they are not practicing pol theory like how the 'greats' did (Plato, Hobbes, etc.), and they are but partisans caught up in the politics of a world dominated by ideological conflict.
