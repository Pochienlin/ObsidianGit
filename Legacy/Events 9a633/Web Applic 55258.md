In programmers‚Äô language: `Bootstrap = bootstrap.min.css + bootstrap.min.js`

# Using Bootstrap

Using BootstrapCDN (CDN: Content Delivery Network)

- A system of distributed servers (network) that deliver webpages and other Web content to a user based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the webpage and a content delivery server.

<aside>
üí° This will load the libraries through the CDN - not from your local server.

```html
<head>
	<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
		rel="stylesheet‚Äú
		integrity="sha384-KyZXEAg3QhqLMpG8r+8fhAXLRk2vvoC2f3B09zVXn8CA5QIVfZOJ3BCsw2P0p/We"
		crossorigin="anonymous">
</head>
<body>
	<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"
		integrity="sha384-U1DAWAznBHeqEIlVSCgzq+c9gqGAJn5c/t99JyeKa9xxaYpSvHU5awsuZVVFIhvj"
		crossorigin="anonymous">
	</script>
</body>
```

The `integrity` attribute allows a browser to check the fetched script to ensure that the code is never loaded if the source has been manipulated.

The `crossorigin` attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request. CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, and is a mechanism that allows resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside their own domain.

- ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù means no credentials (from your local server) will be sent over to the destination server
