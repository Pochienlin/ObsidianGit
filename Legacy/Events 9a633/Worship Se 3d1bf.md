    ### **Paul’s Use of His Freedom**
    
    **19** Though I am free and belong to no one, I have made myself a slave to everyone, to win as many as possible. **20** To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law), so as to win those under the law. **21** To those not having the law I became like one not having the law (though I am not free from God’s law but am under Christ’s law), so as to win those not having the law. **22** To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some. **23** I do all this for the sake of the gospel, that I may share in its blessings.
    

Corinth is economically effective and socially diverse like Singapore

- Society then is segregated among the enslaved and the free

## Quick takeaways

# Love from beneath

> **19** Though I am free and belong to no one, I have made myself a slave to everyone, to win as many as possible.
> 

How to explain this point?

- Not a way of loving or serving, but an attitude
- Not love by being a slave, accurate but the connotation is weird (especially for the global churches)
- Love from beneath → have a servanthood attitude

By serving

- We have chosen to give up on our rights
- We have chosen a Christ-like attitude
    - Jesus, James and John on who sits on the left and the right of the throne (Mark 10:41-45)
        
        > **41** When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John. **42** Jesus called them together and said, “You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. **43** Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, **44** and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all. **45** For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”

# Love by Adapting

> **20** To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law), so as to win those under the law. **21** To those not having the law I became like one not having the law (though I am not free from God’s law but am under Christ’s law), so as to win those not having the law. **22** To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some.

Paul adapts to help

1. Jews, 
2. not under the law, 
3. not having the law, 
4. the weak

In that era, slaves have to adapt to their master's faith. Paul will adapt to environment as much as his faith allows him to.

1. v20: To the Jews... but he *is* a Jew
    1. He sees himself as a new creation in Christ
    2. Christian who happens to be a Jew, not the other way round
2. Under the law – those who practice pharasaic Judaism
    1. e.g. diet
3. v21: not having law = Gentiles
    1. but not licencious – under Christ's law

# Love for the sake of the gospel

> **18** For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.

- 1 Corinthians 1

How do you apply this for National Day?

> **23** I do all this for the sake of the gospel, that I may share in its blessings.
