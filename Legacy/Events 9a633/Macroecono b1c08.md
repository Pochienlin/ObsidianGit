## Chapter 1: Introduction

- LO 1.1 State the two focuses of study in macroeconomics, the key differences between microeconomics and macroeconomics, and the similarities between microeconomics and macroeconomics.
    
    
    ## Focuses of Macroeconomics
    
    > Macroeconomics is the study of the behavior of large collections of economic agents.
    > 
    
    ### Focuses:
    
    1. Long-run growth
    2. Business cylces
    
    ### Interests of study:
    
    1. Aggregate behavior of consumers and firms, 
    2. behavior of governments, 
    3. overall level of economic activity in individual countries, 
    4. eco-nomic interactions among nations, 
    5. effects of fiscal and monetary policy
    
    ## Micro vs. Macro
    
    Macro: 
    
    - deals with the overall effects on economies of the choices that all economic agents make,
    
    Micro: 
    
    - choices of individual consumers or firms.
    
    ### Blurring Lines: Common tools
    
    1. Economic models
    
    From microeconomic principles, 
    
    - descriptions of consumers and firms,
    - their objectives and constraints,
    - how they interact,
    
    models are typically analyzed and fit to data using methods similar to those used by microeconomists.
    
    ### Two focuses as distinction:
    
    Long-run growth
    
    increase in a nation‚Äôs productive capacity and average standard of living that occurs over a long period of time, 
    
    business cycles 
    
    short-run ups and downs, or booms and recessions, in aggregate economic activity.
    
- LO 1.2 Explain the key features of trend growth and deviations from trend in per capita gross domestic product in the United States from 1900 to 2014.
    
    ![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled.png)
    
    ## Observations
    
    1. sustained growth in per capita GDP during the period 1900‚Äì2014. 
        1. In 1900, the average income for an American was $5,188 (2009 dollars), and this grew to $50,051 (2009 dollars) in 2014. Thus, the average American became almost ten times richer in real terms over the course of 114 years, which is quite remarkable! 
    2. While growth in per capita real GDP was sustained over long periods of time in the United States during the period 1900‚Äì2014, this growth was certainly not steady. 
        1. Growth was higher at some times than at others, and there were periods over which per capita real GDP declined. These fluctuations in economic growth are business cycles.
    3. Two key, unusual business cycle events
        1. Great Depression and WWII
        2. these events dwarf any other 20th-century business cycle events in the United States in terms of the magnitude of the short-run change in economic growth. 
            1. Great Depression: 
                1. real GDP per capita dropped from a peak of $8,677 (2009 dollars) per person in 1929 to a low of $6,192 (2009 dollars) per person in 1933, 
                    1. decline of about 29%. 
            2. At the peak of war production in 1944, GDP had risen to $16,181 (2009 dollars) per person, an increase of 161% from 1933. 
            3. Wild gyrations in aggregate economic activity over a 15-year period 
    4. Other business cycle upturns and downturns in the growth of per capita real GDP in the United States that, 
        1. though less dramatic than the Great Depression or World War II, represent impor- tant macroeconomic events in U.S. history.
    
    ## To Ponder:
    
    1. What causes sustained economic growth?
    2. Could economic growth continue indefinitely, or is there some limit to growth?
    3. Is there anything that governments can or should do to alter the rate of eco nomic growth?
    4. What causes business cycles?
    5. Could the dramatic decreases and increases in economic growth that occurred during the Great Depression and World War II be repeated?
    6. Should governments act to smooth business cycles?
    
    ## Analysing data
    
    ### Growth Rate | $g_t=\frac{y_t}{y_{t-1}}$
    
    - Where $y_t$= per capita real GDP in year t
    
    Since $ln(1+g_t)\approx g_t,$
    
    $$
    \implies ln(\frac{y_t}{y_{t-1}})\approx g_t
    $$
    
    $$
    ‚Åç
    $$
    
    > ln yt - ln yt - 1 is the slope of the graph of the natural logarithm of yt 
    between periods t - 1 and t,
    > 
    
    slope of the graph of the natural logarithm of a time series yt is a good approximation to the growth rate of yt **when the growth rate is small.**
    
    ![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%201.png)
    
    ![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%202.png)
    
    except for the Great Depression and World War II, a straight line would fit the graph quite well. That is, over the period 1900‚Äì2014 (again, except for the Great Depression and World War II), growth in per capita real GDP has been ‚Äúroughly‚Äù constant at about 2.0% per year.
    
    ## Two components
    
    - Decomposing real per capita GDP ‚Üí trend + business cycle components
    
    simpler and more productive to consider separately the theory that explains trend growth and the theory that explains business cycles, which are the deviations from trend.
    
    **Trend** as an approximation of growth rate g
    
    **business cycle component** of real per capita GDP ‚Üí deviations of real per capita GDP from a smooth trend fit to the data.
    
    - business cycle component of the natural log of real per capita GDP = black line - colored line in Figure 1.3.
    
    ![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%203.png)
    
    - During the Great Depression the percentage deviation from trend in real per capita GDP was close to -20,, whereas the percentage deviation from trend was about 20% during World War II. In the period after World War II, which is the focus of most business cycle analysis, the deviations from trend in real per capita GDP are at most about $¬±5\%$
        - The extremely large deviation from trend in real per capita GNP in the late 1920s is principally a statistical artifact of the particular detrending procedure used here, which is akin to drawing a smooth curve through the time series.
        - The presence of the Great Depression forces the growth rate in the trend to decrease long before the Great Depression actually occurs.
- LO 1.3 Explain why models are useful in macroeconomics.
    - For most economic theories experimental verification is simply impossible. Most experiments that could be informative are simply too costly to carry out,
        1. For example, suppose an economist constructs a theory that implies that U.S. output would drop by half if there were no banks in the United States. 
        2. To evaluate this theory, we could shut down all U.S. banks for a year to see what would happen. 
        3. Of course, we know in advance that banks play a very important role in helping the U.S. economy function efficiently, and that shutting them down for a year would likely cause significant irreparable damage.
        4. It is extremely unlikely, therefore, that the experiment would be performed.
    
    Economic model is to capture the essential features of the world needed for analyzing a particular economic problem.
    
    - model must be simple ‚Üí leave out some ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù features of actual economies.
        
        basic structure of a macroeconomic model is a description of
        the following features:
        
        1. The consumers and firms that interact in the economy
        2. The set of goods that consumers wish to consume
        3. Consumers‚Äô preferences over goods
        4. The technology available to firms for producing goods
        5. The resources available
    
    ### Prediction from model:
    
    1. Know the golas of consumers and firms
        1. Assume **optimisation**
    2. Specify how consistency is achieved in actions of consumers and firms
        1. Economy must be in **equilibrium**
        2. **Competitive equilibrium** as the most used
            1. assume that goods are bought and sold on markets in which consumers and firms are price-takers; 
                1. they behave as if their actions have no effect on market prices.
            2. equilibrium when market prices are such that the quantity of each good offered for sale (quantity supplied) is equal to the quantity that economic agents want to buy (quantity demanded) in each market.
    
    ### Questioning the model
    
    One way to think of this process is that the economic model is an experimental apparatus, and we want to attempt to run experi- ments using this apparatus.
    
    An experiment we might want to conduct with the economic growth model is to ask, for example, how historical growth performance would have differed in the United States had the level of gov- ernment spending been higher. 
    
    - Would aggregate economic activity have grown at a higher or a lower rate?
    - How would this have affected the consumption of goods?
    - Would economic welfare have been higher or lower?
    
    <aside>
    üí° do not stick to a single all-purpose model
    
    macroeconomic research is a process whereby we continually attempt to develop better models, along with better methods for analyzing those models
    
    </aside>
    
- LO 1.4 Discuss how microeconomic principles are important in constructing useful macroeconomics models. (brick vs economy)
    - To confidently predict the effects of a policy change on aggregate behavior, we must analyze how the change in policy affects individual consumers and firms.
        - For example, if the federal government changes the income tax rate, and we are interested in the macroeconomic effects of this policy change,
            - use microeconomic principles to determine how a change in the tax rate affects an individual consumer‚Äôs labor supply and consumption decisions,
                - based on optimizing behavior.
            - aggregate these decisions to arrive at a conclusion that is consistent with how the individuals in the economy behave.
    - Throwing a brick from a building does not affect the behavior of the molecules within the brick in any way that would significantly change the trajectory of the brick.
    - Changes in government policy, however, generally alter the behavior of consumers and firms in ways that significantly affect the behavior of the economy as a whole.
    - [optional] What the Lucas Critique is
        
        Macroeconomists were not always sympathetic to the notion that macro models should be microeconomically sound. Indeed, before the rational expectations revolu- tion in the 1970s, which generally introduced more microeconomics into macroeco- nomics, most macroeconomists worked with models that did not have solid microeconomic foundations, though there were some exceptions.4 The argument that macroeconomic policy analysis can be done in a sensible way only if microeconomic behavior is taken seriously was persuasively expressed by Robert E. Lucas, Jr. in a journal article published in 1976.5 This argument is often referred to as the Lucas critique.
        
    
- LO 1.5 Explain why there is disagreement among macroeconomists, and what they disagree about.
    
    > Keynesian or non-Keynesian: business cycle theory and the role of the government in smoothing business cycles over time
    > 
    
    ### Old Keynesian Model
    
    (J. M. Keynes‚Äôs General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, published in 1936)
    
    based on the notion that wages and prices are sticky in the short run, and do not change sufficiently quickly to yield efficient outcomes. 
    
    government intervention through monetary and fiscal policy can correct the inefficiencies in private markets. 
    
    ### Non-Keynesian theories
    
    (e.g. real business cycle theoryby Edward Prescott and Finn Kydland in the early 1980s)
    
    government policy aimed at smoothing business cycles is at best ineffective and at worst detrimental to the economy‚Äôs performance.
    
    ### Neo-Keynesian thoughts
    
    coordination failures and New Keynesian economics.
    
    **coordination failure model:** 
    
    economy can be stuck in a bad equilibrium, 
    
    - not because of sticky wages and prices,
    - but because economic agents are self-fulfillingly pessimistic.
    
    **New Keynesian models:**
    
    - sticky wages and prices,
    - use the microeconomic tools that all modern macroeconomists use.
- LO 1.6 List the 12 key ideas that will be covered in this book.
    - What is produced and consumed in the economy is determined jointly by the economy‚Äôs productive capacity and the preferences of consumers.
        
        In Chapters 4 and 5, we develop a one-period model of the economy, 
        
        - specifies the technology for producing goods from
            - available resources,
            - the preferences of consumers over goods,
            - how optimizing consumers and firms come together in competitive markets
        
        to determine what is produced and consumed.
        
    - In free market economies, there are strong forces that tend to produce socially efficient economic outcomes.
        
        Social inefficiencies can arise, but for reasons that are well-understood. 
        
        The notion that an unregulated economy peopled by selfish individuals could result in a socially efficient state of affairs is surprising,
        
        - goes back at least as far as Adam Smith‚Äôs Wealth of Nations, written in the 18th century.
        
        In Chapter 5, we show this result in our one-period model, and we explain the circumstances under which social inefficiencies can arise in practice.
        
    - Unemployment is painful for individuals, but it is a necessary evil in modern economies.
        
        There will always be unemployment in a well-functioning economy. 
        
        - Unemployment is measured as the number of people who are not employed and are *actively seeking* work.
        - Since all of these people are looking for something they do not have, unemployment might seem undesirable, but the time unemployed people spend searching for jobs is in general well spent from a social point of view.
        - **It is economically efficient for workers to be well matched with jobs**, in terms of their skills, and if an individual spends a longer time searching for work, this increases the chances of a good match.
        - However, when the average unemployed person needs to spend a longer time searching for work than seems normal, there may be a role for government intervention.
        - In Chapter 6, we explore a modern model of search and matching that can be used to make sense of labor market data and current phenomena.
        
    - Improvements in a country‚Äôs standard of living are brought about in the long run by technological progress.
        
        In Chapters 7 and 8, we study the Solow growth model (along with the Malthusian model of economic growth and an endogenous growth model), 
        
        - framework for understanding the forces that account for growth.
        - Shows that growth in aggregate output is produced by
            - growth in a country‚Äôs capital stock,
            - growth in the labor force, and
            - technological progress.
        - In the long run, however, growth in the standard of living of the average person comes to a stop unless there are continuous technological improvements.
            - economic well-being ultimately cannot be improved simply by constructing more machines and buildings;
            - economic progress depends on continuing advances in knowledge.
        
    - A tax cut is not a free lunch.
        
         When the government reduces taxes, this increases current incomes in the private sector, and it may seem that this implies that people are wealthier and may want to spend more. 
        
        However, if the government reduces taxes and holds its spending constant, it must borrow more, and the government will have to increase taxes in the future to pay off this higher debt. 
        
        Thus, future incomes in the private sector must fall. 
        
        In Chapter 9, we show that there are circumstances under which a current tax cut has no effects whatsoever; the private sector is no wealthier, and there is no change in aggregate economic activity.
        
    - Credit markets and banks play key roles in the macroeconomy.
        
        The advocates of some mainstream economic theories‚Äîincluding theories of economic growth, real business cycle theory, and New Keynesian economics‚Äîhave sometimes argued that consideration of credit markets, and the underlying frictions that make credit markets and banks work imperfectly, are safely ignored.
        
        Macroeconomic events during the global financial crisis of 2008‚Äì2009 have shown that this approach is hazardous. 
        
        - Some standard economic tools can be used to
            - make sense of macroeconomic financial events,
            - determine the appropriate fiscal and monetary policy responses to a financial crisis.
        
        In Chapter 10, we analyze credit market imperfections and show how they matter for financial crises,
        
        Aggregate implications of financial crises in Chapters 11‚Äì14, along with some issues related to banking in Chapter 18.
        
    - What consumers and firms anticipate for the future has an important bearing on current macroeconomic events.
        
        In Chapters 9‚Äì11, we consider two-period models in which consumers and firms make dynamic decisions; 
        
        - consumers save for future consumption needs, and firms invest in plant and equipment so as to produce more in the future.
            - If consumers anticipate, for example, that their future incomes will be high, they want to save less in the present and consume more,
                - important implications for current aggregate production, employment, and interest rates.
            - If firms anticipate that a new technological innovation will come on line in the future, this makes them more inclined to invest today in new plant and equipment,
                - affects aggregate production, employment, and interest rates.
        - Consumers and firms are forward-looking in ways that matter for current aggregate economic activity and for government policy.
    - Money takes many forms, and society is much better off with it than without it. Once we have it, changing its quantity ultimately does not matter.
        
        What differentiates money from other assets is its *value as a medium of exchange*, 
        
        - makes economic transactions much easier in developed economies.
        - Currently in the United States, there are several assets that act as a medium of exchange, including U.S. Federal Reserve notes and transactions deposits at banks.
        
        In Chapters 12 and 18, we explore the role of money and banking in the economy. 
        
        - One important result in Chapter 12 is that a one-time increase in the money supply, brought about by the central bank, has **no long-run effect** on any real economic magnitudes in the economy; it only increases all prices in the same proportion.
    - Business cycles are similar, but they can have many causes.
        
        In Chapter 3, we show that there are strong regularities in how aggregate macroeconomic variables fluctuate over the business cycle. 
        
        In Chapters 12‚Äì14, we also study some theo- ries that can potentially explain business cycles.
        
        The fact that there is more than one business cycle theory to choose from does not mean that only one can be right and all the others are wrong, though some may be more right than others. 
        
        - Potentially, all of these theories shed some light on why we have business cycles and what can be done about them.
    - Countries gain from trading goods and assets with each other, but trade is also a source of shocks to the domestic economy.
        
        Economists tend to support the lifting of trade restrictions, as free trade allows a country to exploit its comparative advantage in production and, thus, make its citizens better off. 
        
        However, the integration of world financial and goods markets implies that events in other countries can cause domestic business cycles. 
        
        In Chapters 16 and 17, we explore how changes in goods prices and interest rates on world markets affect the domestic economy.
        
    - In the long run, inflation is caused by growth in the money supply.
        
        Inflation, the rate of growth in the average level of prices, can vary over the short run for many reasons. 
        
        Over the long run, however, the rate at which the central bank (the Federal Reserve System in the United States) causes the stock of money to grow determines what the inflation rate is. 
        
        We study this process in Chapter 18.
        
    - If there is a short-run trade-off between output and inflation, that has very different implications relative to the relationship between the nominal interest rate and inflation.
        
        In some countries and for some historical periods, a positive relationship appears to exist between the deviation of aggregate output from trend and the inflation rate. 
        
        - This relationship is called the **Phillips curve,** and in general the Phillips curve appears to be quite an unstable empirical relationship.
        
        Another key relationship observed in the macroeconomic data is the **Fisher relation**‚Äî
        
        - a positive correlation between nominal interest rates and the inflation rate.
        
        So-called Neo-Fisherism takes the theory explaining that observation as a guide for monetary policy. 
        
        - For example, a central bank that wants to increase inflation may want to increase nominal interest rates, rather than reducing them, as Phillips curve reasoning might dictate.
        - We discuss these issues in Chapter 15.
        
- LO 1.7 List the key observations that motivate questions we will try to answer in this book.
    
    ## Aggregate Labour Productivity $\frac{Y}{N}$
    
    Where Y is aggregate output and N is employment

    ![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%204.png)
    
    - Explaining Fig. 1.5
        
        In Figure 1.5, we plot the log of average labor productivity for the United States, measured as the log of real gross domestic product per worker. 
        
        Here, we show the log of average labor productivity (the blue line), because then the slope of the graph denotes the growth rate in average labor productivity. 
        
        ### Key features
        
        - average labor productivity grew at a high rate during the 1950s and most of the 1960s,
        - growth slowed down from the late 1960s until the early 1980s,
        - productivity growth increased beginning in the mid-1980s and remained high through the 1990s and into the 21st CE.
        - Recently, from 2000 to 2015, we appear to have entered another period of low productivity growth
    - Questions to follow up
        
        Why has productivity growth declined in the period after the global financial crisis? Is this because all the great elements of technological progress‚Äîelectrification, running water, antibiotics, and information technology‚Äîare well behind us? Is this some lingering effect of the financial crisis, and only temporary? ‚Üí See Chapter 7-8
        
    
    ## Unemployment and Vacancies
    
    unemployment need not represent a problem, since unemployment is in general a socially useful search activity that is necessary, though sometimes painful to the individuals involved. 
    
    - If we can understand these features, we can go on to determine how macroeconomic policy can be formulated so that labor markets work as efficiently as possible.
    - In Chapter 6, we introduce two models of search and unemployment,
        
        the second of which is based on the work of Nobel Prize winners Peter Diamond, Dale Mortensen, and Christopher Pissarides. 
        
        These models allow us to explain the determinants of labor force participation, the unemployment rate, the vacancy rate (the fraction of firms searching for workers to hire), and market wages.
        
    
    Some of the features of labor market data that we would like to explain are in Figures 1.6 and 1.7. 
    
    - Figure 1.6

        - generosity of government-provided unemployment insurance,
        - matching efficiency
    - Figure 1.7
        
        
        ![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%206.png)
        
        The dots in the figure represent observations up to the end of 2007 (the beginning of the most recent recession), while the line tracks observations from January 2008 to November 2015. 
        
        A downward sloping curve‚Äîcalled a **Beveridge curve**‚Äîwould fit closely the observations from 2000 to 2007, but the last observations‚Äîbeginning in mid-2009‚Äî fall well north of this Beveridge curve. 
        
        - Given the vacancy rates that were observed from mid-2009 to November 2015, the unemployment rate would typically have been much lower pre-2008.
        - Our search model of unemployment in Chapter 6 suggests that this shifting of the Beveridge curve could be due to mismatch in the labor market.
        
        ‚Üí This mismatch could result 
        
        - from differences between the skills that firms want and what would-be workers possess,
        - or because job vacancies are not in the same geographical regions where the unemployed reside.
    
    ## Taxes, Government Spending, and the Government Deficit
    
    ![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%207.png)
    
    - [Fig 1.8] Note the broad upward trend in both taxes and spending.
        - Total taxes were almost 22% of GDP in 1947, and they increased to about 29% of GDP in 2015, while total spending rose from about 23% of  GDP in 1947 to a high of about 33% of GDP in 2015.
        
        These trends generally reflect an increase in the size of government in the United States relative to the aggregate economy over this period, though spending has clearly outpaced taxes since 2000.
        
        - [Chapters 5 and 11] increased government activity in general causes a **crowding out** of private economic activity.
            - That is, the government competes for resources with the rest of the economy.
            - If the size of the government increases, then through several economic mechanisms there is a reduction in the quantity of spending by private firms on new plant and equipment, and there is a reduction in private consumption expenditures.
    
    ![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%208.png)
    
    - [Fig 1.9] Governments in the United States sometimes spent more than they received in the form of taxes, and sometimes the reverse was true.
        
        Just as is the case for private consumers, the government can in principle spend more than it earns by borrowing and accumulating debt, and it can earn more than it spends and save the difference, thus reducing its debt. 
        
        From Figure 1.9, the government surplus was positive for most of the period from 1948 until 1970, but from 1970 until the late 1990s the surplus was usually negative. 
        
        - When there is a negative government surplus, we say that the government is running a deficit;
            - the government deficit is the negative of the government surplus.
        - The largest government deficits over this period were in 1975, when the deficit exceeded 8% of GDP, and in late 2010, when it reached 11% of GDP.
        - There was only a brief period after the late 1970s when governments in the United States ran a surplus; in 1999, the government surplus reached about 2% of GDP.
        - However, the surplus declined dramatically after 1999, reaching -4, of GDP in 2003 before increasing again and then dropping precipitously in the 2008‚Äì2009 recession.
    - consequences of government deficits
        
        Principal difference between an individual and the government: when the government accumulates debt by borrowing from its citizens, then this is debt that we as a nation owe to ourselves. 
        
        - Then, it turns out that the effects of a government deficit depend on what the source of the deficit is.
            - Is the government running a deficit because taxes have decreased or because government spending has increased?
                - If the deficit is the result of a decrease in taxes, then the gov- ernment debt that is issued to finance the deficit will have to be paid off ultimately by higher future taxes.
                - Running a deficit in this case implies that there is a redistribution of the tax burden from one group to another; one group has its current taxes reduced while another has its future taxes increased.
                - Under some circumstances, these two groups might essentially be the same, in which case there would be no consequences of having the government run a deficit.
        - That government deficits do not matter under some conditions, is called the **Ricardian equivalence theorem**, and we study it in Chapter 9.
        - In the case of a government deficit resulting from higher government spending, there are always implications for aggregate economic activity, as discussed earlier in terms of the crowding out of private spending.
    
    ## Inflation
    
    > is the rate of change in the average level of prices.
    > 
    
    average level of prices is referred to as the price level
    
    ![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%209.png)
    
    the inflation rate as the percentage rate of increase in the consumer price index
    
    - Trends
        1. The inflation rate was high in the late 1940s and during the Korean War, 
        2. quite low in the early 1960s 
        3. began climbing in the late 1960s, 
        4. reaching peaks of about 12% per year in 1975 and about 14% per year in 1980. 
        5. The inflation rate then declined steadily, falling into the negative range in early 2009, increasing, and then declining to close to zero in 2015.
    
    High inflation is economically costly
    
    - High inflation experienced during the 1970s was seen as a problem for monetary policy in the United States.
        - Monetary policymakers felt that growth in the money supply had been driving this high rate of inflation,
        - successfully reduced money growth and inflation during the 1980s.
        - The period from the 1980s until the Great Recession began in late 2007 was one of low inflation.
    - However, in the period after the Great Recession ended in 2009, inflation fell
        - to the point where the inflation rate was consistently below the Fed‚Äôs 2% inflation target over the period 2013‚Äì2015.
    - Problem today: inflation is viewed by monetary policymakers as being too low
        - Recently, central banks have failed in their attempts to increase inflation, through various unconventional means.
        - This has caused macroeconomists to rethink theories of inflation, and to introduce newer, alternative theories that can better fit the data and be more useful for economic policy.
    
    ## Interest rates
    
    affect many private economic decisions, particularly the decisions of consumers as to how much they borrow and lend, and the decisions of firms concerning how much to invest in new plant and equipment
    
    ![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%2010.png)
    
    This is the interest rate in money terms on 91-day U.S. Treasury bills, which are essentially riskless short-term government securities.
    
    - Trend
        
        The short-term nominal interest rate rose on trend through the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, 
        
        reaching a high of more than 15% early in 1980. 
        
        Since then, the nominal interest rate has declined on trend, and it has been close to 0% since late 2008.
        
    - What explains the level of the nominal interest rate?
        
        black line (inflation rate) is measured here by the rate of increase in the consumer price index. 
        
        - The inflation rate tracks the nominal interest rate reasonably closely.
        - Also, several of the peaks in inflation, around 1970, in the mid-1970s, around 1980, around 1990, and in 2001, are coupled with peaks in the nominal interest rate.
        - Nominal interest rate tends to rise and fall with the inflation rate. Why?
            
            Economic decisions are based on real rather than nominal interest rates. 
            
            - The **real interest rate**, roughly speaking, is the **nominal interest rate minus the expected rate of inflation**.
                - real interest rate is the rate that a borrower expects to have to repay, adjusting for the inflation that is expected to occur over the period of time until the borrower‚Äôs debt is repaid.
                - Example
                    
                    If Allen obtains a one-year car loan at an interest rate of 9%, and he expects the inflation rate to be 3% over the next year, then he faces a real interest rate on the car loan of 6%. 
                    
            
            Because economic decisions are based on real interest rates rather than nominal interest rates, market forces tend to determine the real interest rate. 
            
            Therefore, as the inflation rate rises, the nominal interest rate tends to rise along with it.
            
    - Or high (low) nominal interest rates are causing high (low) inflation.
        
        Over the medium to long run, the Fisher effect is an important force determining how monetary policy affects inflation. 
        
        - In neo-Fisherian theory, a central bank that conducts monetary policy by targeting the nominal interest rate may come to the conclusion that the best way to increase inflation is to increase its nominal interest rate target.
    
    ![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%2011.png)
    
    ##real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus the actual rate of inflation. 
    
    This would be the actual real interest rate if consumers and firms could correctly anticipate inflation, so that actual inflation is equal to expected inflation. 
    
    - Consumers and firms cannot correctly anticipate the actual inflation rate.
    - However, given that inflation does not change too much from quarter to quarter, our estimate of the real interest rate has a reasonably small measurement error.
    - The real interest rate fluctuates a great deal over time, and has sometimes been negative,
        - having fallen to about -9% in the late 1940s, to -8% in the early 1950s, and to -7% in 1980. The real rate has been negative for most of the time since the beginning of the financial crisis in late 2008. The period in the mid-1980s was one of particularly high real interest rates.
    
    In the short run, the real interest rate is affected by monetary policy, though there is some disagreement among macroeconomists concerning why the central bank can
    control the real interest rate, and for how long it can do so. 
    
    - Interpretation
        - real interest rate was low in the mid to late 1970s because the Federal Reserve (the Fed) was causing the money supply to grow at a high rate;
            - that is, monetary policy was expansionary and accommodating.
        - As a result of the high inflation caused by this high money growth, the Fed embarked on a contractionary course in the early 1980s, reducing money supply growth and causing the real interest rate to rise.
        - After the mid-1980s, the Fed remained seriously concerned about the possibility that high inflation could reemerge, and thus caused the real interest rate to be historically high.
        - During the business cycle downturn in the early 1990s, the Fed temporarily relaxed, causing the real interest rate to dip to close to 0%.
        - Then, in 2001, the Fed acted to reduce the real interest rate again, in response to a slowdown in aggregate economic activity. As there appeared to be no threat of serious inflation and economic activity had not picked up significantly, the real interest rate continued to fall through late 2003.
        - Then, when the economy was growing at a high rate, and there was a greater threat from inflation, the real interest rate increased, through 2006. In 2008, the Fed
        aggressively reduced the real interest rate in response to the financial crisis and the developing recession.
    - While the rate of money growth may affect real interest rates in the long run, monetary policy is aimed not at setting the long-run real interest rate but at determining long-run inflation while staying in tune with the short-run effects of monetary policy.
    
    ## Credit Markets and the Financial Crisis
    
    - Why this shouldn't threaten faith in macroecons theories
        
        The financial crisis and subsequent severe recession in 2008‚Äì2009 were essentially unanticipated events among professional macroeconomists. 
        
        Though these events have caused macroeconomists to revise their thinking concerning the importance of credit markets, banking, and financial relationships for aggregate economic activity, this should not challenge our confidence in the use of mainstream macroeconomic theory to make sense of empirical observations and guide economic policy.
        
    
    Economic theory is helpful in understanding the recent crisis is how credit market ‚Äúfrictions‚Äù or ‚Äúimperfections‚Äù act to amplify shocks to the economy.
    
    Asymmetric information
    
    situation where the economic actors on one side of a market have more information than the economic actors on the other side of the market. 
    
    ### Example: the credit market
    
    financial institutions that extend loans in the credit market may have less information about the creditworthiness of would-be borrowers than do the borrowers themselves. 
    
    In these circumstances, even borrowers who are very unlikely to default on a loan may be forced to pay a high interest rate on the loan, as lending institutions are unable to differentiate good borrowers from bad borrowers. 
    
    Then, interest rates will include a default premium, and this default premium tends to rise as lending institutions become increasingly pessimistic about the average creditworthiness of borrowers. Good borrowers suffer due to the asymmetric information problem.
    
    ![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%2012.png)
    
    - One way to measure the size of the default premium in credit markets is to look at the difference between the long-term interest rate on relatively safe long-term corporate debt, and the interest rate on somewhat risky corporate debt.
    - Figure 1.14 shows the difference (the interest rate ‚Äúspread‚Äù) between AAA-rated (safe) corporate bonds and BAA-rated (somewhat risky) corporate bonds for the period 1919‚Äì2015.
        - Very large spike in this spread during the Great Depression in the 1930s, and that each of the recessions since 1970 is associated with an increase in the spread (see Figure 1.14). F
        - Size of the spread in the 2008‚Äì2009 recession was the largest observed since the Great Depression.
            - This points to a large increase in the perceived average risk of default in credit markets.
    
    ## Current Account Surplus
    
    - Background: trade helps everyone
        
        As the technology for transporting goods and information across countries has advanced and government-imposed impediments to trade have been reduced in the post‚ÄìWorld War II period, the United States has become a more open economy. That is, trade in goods and in assets between the United States and the rest of the world has increased. 
        
        Trade allows countries to specialize in production and exploit their comparative advantages.
        
    
    ![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%2013.png)
    
    U.S. exports increased from about 5% of GDP in 1947 to more than 13% of GDP in 2015, while imports increased from somewhat more than 3% in 1947 to about 16% in 2015.  
    More trade could also expose a given country to the transmission of business cycle fluctuations from abroad, though this need not necessarily be the case. 
    
    - Dramatic decrease in both imports and exports, as percentages of GDP, during the 2008‚Äì2009 recession.
    
    While the level of trade with the outside world is important in terms of aggregate economic activity and how it fluctuates, the balance of trade also plays an important
    role in macroeconomic activity and macroeconomic policymaking. 
    
    - One measure of the balance of trade is the **current account surplus**, which is **net exports** of goods and services (exports minus imports) plus **net factor payments** (net income from abroad).
    
    ![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%2014.png)
    
    In the figure the current account surplus was positive for most of the period 1960‚Äì1985, and it has been negative for most of the period 1985‚Äì2015.
    
    - Why is the current account surplus important?
        - When the current account surplus in the United States is negative (CA deficit)
            - quantity of goods and services purchased abroad by domestic residents > quantity of domestic goods and services purchased by foreigners.
            - To finance this current account deficit, residents of the United States and/or the U.S. government must be borrowing abroad.
    - CA deficit is not necessarily bad
        
        **net exports** of goods and services (exports minus imports) plus **net factor payments** (net income from abroad)
        
        - May be beneficial for a country to borrow in the short run by running a current account deficit so as to smooth aggregate consumption over time.
        - persistent current account deficits may make sense if the associated foreign borrowing is used to finance additions to the nation‚Äôs productive capacity that will allow for higher future living standards.
    - What accounts for movements over time in the current account surplus?
        
        One important influence on the current account surplus is government spending. 
        
        - When the government increases its spending, holding taxes constant, this will increase the government deficit, which needs to be financed by increased government borrowing. Other important influences on the current account surplus are increases in domestic income, which tend to increase imports, and increases in foreign income, which tend to increase exports.

- important macroeconomic variables:
    1. GDP, its decompositions and components;
    2. Inflation and the evolution of cost of living; and
    3. Some labor market statistics.
- Measurement is for 2 purposes:
    1. Identifying, understanding, and explaining phenoma like poverty, income and wealth inequality, unemployment, economic fluctuations and economic growth, and
    2. designing policies or regulations whenever needed.
- We need to define the variables we consider, for definitions tell us
    - what those variables measure, and thus
    - the **suitability** or limitations of using certain pieces of data **for certain purposes**.
        - Example: if we are interested in the welfare of the population, is a variable measuring one aspect of economic activity enough?
- We also need to worry about data **availability** or **quality**:
    - How well do we measure what we would like to measure?
    - Is the **discrepancy** between what the data captures and what we want acceptable for what we want to use it for?
        - Example: if we want to measure the standard of living in a country and it is known that a large fraction of economic activity is not officially recorded and how much is unknown, then official data can be of limited use
        - Yes, unofficial data relates to black or grey markets, or household activities (more later)
- Data collection can be a messy business:
    - It is **costly** to collect data and the better the quality of the data, the costlier it is to gather.
    - Data is typically collected through **administrative** means (e.g., social security and tax databases - CPF and IRAS in Singapore) or through **surveys**.
        - Quality issues:
            - Is data collected by the government (reported by various economic agents) accurate?
                - Issues with less developed nations or ones were **incentives to misreport,** including from officials.
                - Underreporting from a firm can help reduce taxes
            - How representative is a survey?

## Economic Methodology

- Theoretical: it is impractical to capture everything. A model is a simplification.
    - Different models are used in different types of questions, which are broadly consistent with each other
- A model is a series of assumptions
    - Key is to make model as simple as possible in relation to the question
    - Simplifying/ abstracting some phenomina that are not essential for question
    - Be open to modifying the model/ use another one if facts indicate a model abstracts for some elements that appear ex post to be important
- Understanding a model means understanding what it can/cannot explain

### A simple model

![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%2016.png)

Even this simplified representation of the macroeconomy has many
ingredients.

In this course we will use some shortcuts where we feel it is not too
detrimental to our understanding (but always keeping in mind what
the shortcomings of our analysis could thus be):

- The financial sector is, for the most part, restricted to a perfect credit market and no corporate finance issues.
- No intermediate goods and services producers;
    - When firms produce, they use inputs from other firms
    - We simplify it to become one type of firm
- No home production;
- Simple tax structure (lump sum taxes for the most part)
    - Dealing with tax system is too complicated for this purpose
- Closed economy.
    - Open economy comes in international economics (other course)

## GDP

GDP is the acronym for Gross Domestic Product.

It is the total value of final output (goods and services) produced for the market in a given administrative region over a given period:

- Final: as we will see very soon, this is to avoid double-counting the value of inputs.
- Produced: second-hand goods are not included, although services associated with the resale of these goods is included.
- Administrative region: It can be a country, a group of countries, or a region or groups of regions within a country.
- Given Period: GDP is typically reported on quarterly basis and quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year changes are the changes most commonly looked at.
- Data is typically collected and published in the form of National Accounts by a government agency, often a statistical agency, like Singstat in Singapore, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) in the USA, and Eurostat for the EU.
- There are three approaches to measuring GDP, all of which yield the same result in the absence of measurement errors. But in practice there are always measurement errors.
- The three approaches are:
    - the product approach - production or supply-side view;
    - the expenditure approach - spending or demand-side view; and
    - the income approach - split of the value of production across the different factors of production.

We will consider each of these approaches in turn.

<aside>
üí° The three approaches to GDP counting are: Product, expenditure, income. In theory yields the same results, but in practice, measurement errors hinders this

</aside>

- On Jacquet's use of Williamson TB
    
    This is a very simplified economy, but it provides all the elements we need to understand how the three di¬ßerent approaches to computing GDP function.
    
    Instead of repeating here what is written in the textbook I instead present a graph representing the economy (see next slide).
    
    This graph has the advantage of showing all the flows of resources in a typical economy in a compact fashion.
    
- Textbook example: the **value-added approach**
    - GDP is obtained by adding the value added (VA) by all economic agents selling goods and services in the market.
    - The VA by an economic agent is the value of the goods and services sold from which we subtract the value of intermediate goods and services used in the production, although we do not subtract direct labor cost:
        - second-hand goods do not appear, only the services facilitating trade do.

![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%2020.png)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Product Approach

- Calculation in Williamson Example
    
    ![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%2021.png)
    
    - Why subtract the value of intermediate goods and services?
        
        Because we would otherwise count more than once the value of the intermediate goods and services
        
        In WilliamsoniÃÅs example, if we do not subtract the value of coconuts purchased by the restaurant from the coconut producers, we would count the value of coconut twice:
        
        - once in the value of the sales of the coconut producers and then a second time in the value of the sale of the restaurant.
        - In fact, the value (of goods ad services) created by the restaurant is what it offers to its customers on top of what the coconut producer offers itself.
- The VA of some activities is rather obvious whereas it is less so for others.
    
    Car or bicycle manufacturer: Even if it produces no parts, purchases parts from suppliers and puts them together, its value added is in design, assembly, etc.
    
    - Reseller/distributor: transport, information and advice on product, and possibly after sales service.
    - Bar: the VA for drinks is the setting (chair, table, glass, ice, heating or air conditioning, protection from rain, etc.).
- Value of government services:
    - there is often no or limited market (healthcare in some countries, but prices rarely completely free), sometimes services are not even purchased (e.g., primary and secondary education; law and order; national defense).
    - Valuation is thus not straightforward and is often done at cost of inputs.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Expenditure Approach

In this approach, GDP is obtained by adding all spending on all final goods and services production in the economy.

In National Accounts 

$$
Total\;Expenditure = C + I + G + NX,
$$

where NX = X - M.
In Williamson's example:

$$
I=NX=0,
$$

$$
C=8+30=38,
$$

$$
G = 5.5, 
$$

$$
\therefore GDP = 38 + 5.5 = 43.5.
$$

Remarks

1. We only count the value of final goods and services:
    1. we do not count intermediate goods and services, for their value is already included in the value of final goods and services.
    2. we would otherwise double count the value of inputs.
2.  We only count the value of what is produced in the economy:
    1. Final goods and services purchased in the economy but produced outside the economy count as imports and thus appear negatively in NX.
    2. Symmetrically, goods and services produced in the country but sold overseas are exports.
3. Government expenditure do not include:
    1. Transfers, that is payment to households or firms that do not correspond to the purpose of goods or services rendered;
    2. Interest payment on debt. (note: government!)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Income approach

- In this approach, GDP is computed as being the sum of all income received by economic agents contributing to production
    - when income is net of taxes we need to add back taxes, like for dividends paid out of after-tax profits;
    - we also need to add back depreciation of capital, because it is taken out when computing after-tax profits.
    - We can in general split income into wage or labor income (revenue from work) and capital income (revenue from wealth/capital). Singstat splits them into Compensation to Employees (labor income) and Gross Operating Surplus (capital income), to which they add taxes in production and imports.
        
        Note that Gross Operating Surplus incorporate rents and inputed rents.
        
        ![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%2022.png)
        

There are types of incomes for which it is easy to tell whether they
correspond to labor or capital income:

- wages or benefits of employees with no stock in their firm ‚Üí labor income;
- revenue from real estate, interest on bonds or dividends from stocks for households not employed in those firms ‚Üí capital income.

What about business owners (proprietors' income) or stock-options or similar forms of remuneration for employees?

- Are these remunerations capital or labor income?
- In fact, these people work in the firm and at the same time own (part of) the firm.
- One strategy is to split these types of ambiguous incomes according to aggregate fractions, so that if labor share is 2/3 and capital share is 1/3, then 2/3 of proprietors' income is attributed to labor and the remaining 1/3 is attributed to capital.

Note that the expenditure and income approaches to computing GDP yield what is known as the income-expenditure identity

![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%2023.png)

And the product and expenditure approaches yield market clearing for final goods and services:

![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%2024.png)

### ‚ûï Adding Inventory investment

Still following Williamson's example, assume that everything is as before except that the coconut producer produces 13 million coconuts instead of 10 millions. There are thus 3 millions of unsold coconuts, which are stored as inventory, and let value them at current market price for a total of $6 millions.

- The coconuts in inventory could be valued at some other price, for the instance the price expected for next period.

Value-added approach: we have that

Coconut Producer:
Restaurant:
Government:

VA = Total Revenue = 26 - 0
VA = Total Rev. - Cost of Coconut = 30 - 12
VA = 5.5 - 0,

$$
GDP = Total\;VA = 26 +18 + 5.5 = 49.5.
$$

Expenditure approach: Since inventory is by convention part of investment, we have that

- But inventory is not really expenditure on final goods or services!
    
    Yes, but it is treated as if the coconut producer sold the coconuts to itself.
    

$$
C =38m,I =6m,G =5.5m, NX =0m,
$$

$$
GDP = 49.5m.

$$

Income approach

The difference here with the previous example is that profits of the coconut producers are $19m instead of $13m when the inventory is valued at current market prices.

The value of the inventory is the income the firm could have generated if it had sold it in the current period, and one can see why
using the current market price might not be the right way to value current inventory.

- oil or any other commodity: the market price will change if the quantity supplied changes.
- In practice, some firms are building inventories, others are decreasing inventories, and in normal times there might not be significant changes in prices faced by firms when they are price takers....

[Practice: Question 1 on page 86 in Williamson](Macroecono%20b1c08/Practice%20Q%20023a7.md)

### ‚ûï Adding international trade

Suppose now, following Williamson, that all is as in the example without investment except the restaurant imports 2 million coconuts at the price of $2 each.

Value-Added approach: There is no change for the coconut producer or the government, while the restaurant's value of inputs has increased by $4m,

therefore only the restaurant's value added has changed, decreasing by
$4m to $9m, and GDP is $4m lower at $39.5m.

Expenditure Approach: There is no change in either C, I, or G, and naturally we now have that

NX = X  M = $0m  $4m = $4m.
We thus have that Total Expenditure is now $39.5m.

Income Approach: The only change is with the after-tax profits of the restaurant, which are now $4m lower at $7m.

Labor income and taxes are unchanged, while capital income is reduced by $4m, so aggregate income is lower at $39.5m.

## GNP

GNP measures the value of output produced by domestic factors of
production, whether or not the production takes place inside the
region considered.

- If a Singapore owned company, say a hospitality group, owns hotels and resorts throughout Asia, the managerial income and profits are part of SingaporeiÃÅs GNP; and vice versa.
    
    Differences between GDP and GNP are often but not always small - see FRED website of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis.
    

[Question 2 on page 86 in Williamson](Macroecono%20b1c08/Question%202%20b70f2.md)

The adjustment between GDP and GNP is Net Factor Payments
(NFP):

$$
GNP = GDP + NFP.
$$

NFP is the payment to Singapore factors producing overseas (revenue
inaÃÅow) minus payment to foreign factors producing in Singapore
(revenue outflow):

### Is GDP Exhaustive?

Underground economy, that is market economic activity which is not
officially recorded:

- Black market: Illegal activities, like illegal drug, prostitution, or
gambling activities.
- Grey market: legal activities but not recorded, for the purpose of
avoiding taxes or regulations, or simply because they correspond to
informal transactions, like baby-sitting.

Home production: It is the value of services that are produced within
a household. 

cleaning and cooking: recorded market transaction when hiring a cleaner or when purchasing food outside, but not recorded when cooking at home 

(although cleaning and cooking equipment and cost of cleaning products and cooking ingredients can be recorded).

childcare: recorded market transaction when send a child to a childcare or a registered carer, but not when one of the parents or other family members who do it for free.

GDP misses many potentially important economic aspects:

Income and wealth inequality: how are income and wealth distributed?
The Gini coefficient is one statistics used to measure the degree of
inequality.

Leisure: How many hours do per worker is needed to obtain GDP? A
high GDP could reaÃÅect low leisure.

There are also important aspects of general well-being that GDP does not capture:

Potential reading: "Measuring What Counts," by Stiglitz, Fitoussi, and Durand.

education (achievement and opportunities), access to healthcare; pollution level (access to clean air and water), personal freedoms, and so on and so forth.

The relative estimated size of the informal economy can vary a lot across countries.

Characteristics of a country that can matter: 

- Split between rural and urban populations - production of own food in
the country.
- Degree of development - there tends to be less specialization in less
developed country and therefore less services purchased on markets;
- Nature of economic institutions, like the provision of public good or similar services, regulations, taxation, and enforcement.

An example, childcare:

institutionalized in some countries (childcare centres or professional nannies), while in others informal childcare arrangements are more common (family members, like parents themselves or grandparents);

in the former there is income and thus appears in GDP, while in the second there is formal payment (there might be some compensation in some other ways), but typically these will not appear in GDP (childcarer might even had to quit his/her job and thus lead to a fall in income).

## Components of aggregate expenditure

Consumption:

- non-durable goods ( 3 years)
- durable goods (> 3 years), so like investment in nature. (in the sense that it is a purchase with depreciating value over time)
- services - what about advance purchase like a warranty and servicing contracts?

Investment:

- Fixed investment, in structures or equipment;
- Inventory investment.

Net Exports: 

For many countries they are a minor contributing factor to GDP, but exports and imports each can be a large fraction of GDP, sometimes even exceeding GDP itself, like it is the case for Singapore.

Government expenditures:

- expenditures on final goods and services at all levels of government;
- government consumption vs government investment;
- transfers are not included, as they are simply moving resources from some economic agents to others and do not involve any creation of value or expenditure or income at the aggregate.

In most advanced economies consumption is by far the largest component of GDP, but investment plays a very important role in business cycle fluctuations (more on this later in the course and in macro 2).

## Input-output table

In the graph with flows of goods and services and funds, etc., flows of goods and services within the firm sector can be represented with an Input-Output (I/O) table.

In principle such a table can be done with each firm representing one column and one line, but this would be too onerous to do in practice.

![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%2025.png)

An I/O table is built at a given level of aggregation (sector, sub-sector, etc.) according to come o¬¢ cial classification and it can then be used to:

1. Compute the value-added of each sector, and then GDP.
2. Expand an I/O table to include costs and taxes to compute after-tax profits for the purpose of computing GDP using the expenditure method.
- Applied to Williamson
    
    ![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%2026.png)
    
    - How is the previous table changed if instead $4m of the coconut sale by the coconut producer to the restaurant is for bowls made of coconut the restaurant uses to serve its customers?
        
        ![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%2027.png)
        
    

## Nominal vs Real GDP

In our example we expressed GDP and its components in current dollars, that is, we computed the nominal value of GDP.

Prices are expected to reflect the value attached to goods and services.

However, we would like to be able to compare GDP over time and across countries, so as to have a sense of how the production capacity and standard of living evolve over time and compare across countries.

Issue:

prices, including relative prices, change/are di¬ßerent, and

the composition of goods and services also changes/is different.

Economists thus build price indices to measure how much of the change in a variable like GDP is due to changes in prices.

> A price index is a weighted average of the prices of a given set of goods and services.
> 
- If the basket of goods and services considered is representative of all goods and services in the economy it is a measure of the price level.
- The evolution of the price level enables us to measure the inflation rate, which is the rate of change of the price level from one time period to another.
- We can set determine how much of the change in nominal GDP is purely nominal, i.e., due to change in prices, and how much is real, i.e., due to changes in quantities of goods and services produced.
- We follow the example in Williamson on pages 68 and 69.
    
    
    The data is summarized in the following table, which reproduces table
    2.10 on page 69:
    
    ![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%2028.png)
    
    Nominal GDP at date t is
    
    ![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%2029.png)
    
    More generally, if there are I goods and services in the economy indexed by i, nominal GDP at date t is
    
    ![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%2030.png)
    
    In Williamson's example we thus have that
    
    GDP1 ¬†= ($1.00  50) + ($0.80  100) = $130, and
    GDP2 ¬†= ($1.25  80) + ($1.60  120) = $292.
    
    And the gross growth rate of nominal GDP between periods 1 and 2 is
    
    ![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%2031.png)
    

### Role of the base year

- How much of the nominal GDP growth is real and how much is nominal?
    
    To answer we need to choose a base year, that is the year whose prices are used to compute real GDP.
    
    If we choose period 1 as the base year we have that real GDP for dates 1 and 2 are respectively
    
    ![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%2032.png)
    
    This then implies a gross growth rate for real GDP
    
    ![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%2033.png)
    
    If we instead choose period 2 as the base year, we have that real GDP for dates 1 and 2 are respectively
    
    ![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%2034.png)
    
    This then implies a gross growth rate for real GDP
    
    ![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%2035.png)
    
    We thus obtain two di¬ßerent results for the two di¬ßerent base years, and thus the choice of the base year matters.
    
    The difference arises because relative prices change between the two periods:
    
    ![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%2036.png)
    

### Chain-Weighted method

[Is it problematic that the growth rate of real GDP depends on the base year chosen? If yes, how do we solve that?](Macroecono%20b1c08/Is%20it%20prob%20679bf.md)

### Implicit Price Deflator

Based on the method presented to compute real GDP we have a natural measure of the price level, the implicit GDP price deflator:

![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%2037.png)

There are as many implicit GDP price deaÃÅators as they are methods to compute real GDP.

In Williamson's example we can thus compute the implicit price deflator with period 1 or period 2 as the base period, or with the chain-weighted method, and we obtain Table 2.11 on page 72:

![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%2038.png)

## Measuring the Cost of Living

- The evolution of the implicit GDP price deflator captures the changes
in the price of the basket of OÃànal goods and services of the economy.
- It thus captures changes in the price of consumption, investment,
government expenditures, and net exports,...
- ...and it does therefore not necessarily capture well the evolution of
the cost of living for households whose expenditures appear only in
aggregate private consumption C.
- However, alternatives to the implicit GDP deflator exists, the
**Consumer Price Index (CPI)** and the **implicit consumption price
deflator.**

CPI:

tracks the evolution of the cost of a given basket;
it thus does not capture well changes in consumption patterns due to changes in relative prices.

Implicit consumption price deflator:

work as the implicit GDP price deflator, for the private consumption part of GDP;

it takes into account changes in consumption patterns due to changes
in relative prices.

## Measurement problems: Quality

The quality of goods and services changes over time and changes in
prices do not necessarily capture this well - think of computer chips.

A lack of proper adjustment for improvement in quality implies that
the growth of GDP is biased downwards.

To see the issue more clearly consider the following ways of expressing
GDP where the quality of goods and services appears explicitly:

![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%2039.png)

Measuring true inflation means measuring the rate of change of $p_t$, the price per quality-adjusted unit. This requires to know the evolution of $m_t^i$ , the quality in each unit.

In fact, what we measure is

![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%2040.png)

where $P_t^i$ is the price measured for good or service i.

And without quality adjustment we thus get

![Untitled](Macroecono%20b1c08/Untitled%2041.png)

that is changes in quality appear in price changes.

There is a similar issue with new products and services:

some new goods or services are minor innovations, others are major;

not taking into account the increase in quality arising from the creation from new goods and services, then GDP growth is biased downward and inflation is biased upwards.

[An exercise: Questions 4 and 5 on page 87 in Williamson](Macroecono%20b1c08/An%20exercis%2095f07.md)

## Measurement problems

Comparison across countries:

Exchange rate e: the price level, even adjusting for the basket considered, tends to be greater in richer countries than in poorer
countries (known as the Penn effect): $P > eP^*$. 

Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is one solution to correct for the problem: multiply nominal quantities for poorer country by $P/P^*$ instead of e (this is what is done in the Penn World Tables).

Quality, again: 

the goods or services might not necessarily be the same in two countries, and thus comparing restaurant meals in
Singapore and in the US cannot be done by simply looking at the price or even the relative price.

Other consideration: 

the comparison across locations within a country is typically done with the same deaÃÅator: NYC vs Idaho...

## Savings and wealth

- It is important to distinguish between **savings** on the one hand and wealth on the other hand.
- Savings is a **flow**, a quantity measured over a given period of time, while wealth is a **stock**, a quantity measured at a given point in time.
- Wealth comes from accumulated past savings, plus whatever income (i.e., returns) is generated from past savings.
- Example: If there are 3 periods in which a household has no initial wealth, saves $s_1$, $s_2$, and $s_3$ in the 3 periods respectively and the rate
of return the household can obtain on its wealth is r, then wealth at the end of period 1 is s1, wealth at the end of period 2 is $(1+r)s_1 +s_2$, and wealth at the end of period 3 is $(1+r)2s_1 +(1+r)s_2 +s_3$.

## Savings, Investment, and the Capital Account

We now finish our study of GDP tying up some loose end and linking income and savings with investment and the current account.

Let us start with the case of a closed economy. In such a case private disposable income for a period is

$$
Y^d =Y+TR+INT-T,
$$

where Y is income (labor and capital income not from the government), TR are transfers received, INT is interest received from ownership of government debt, and T is tax paid to the government.

Private sector savings for the period is $S^p = Y^d - C = Y + TR + INT - T - C$ , while government savings is $S^g =T-TR-INT-G.$

Total savings in the economy is thus

$$
S=S^p+S^g =Y-C-G,
$$

which with the expenditure identity Y = C + I + G implies that S = I, That is:

- investment is financed by savings, or
- wealth, which is the accumulation of savings, is accumulated through investment.

### Open economy

Let us now open the economy. Private disposable income for a period in this case is $Y^d =Y+NFP+TR+INT-T,$

because we need to include net payments received from abroad (NFP ).

Private sector savings for the period is then $S^p = Y d C = Y + NFP + TR + INT - T - C$

while government savings is still $S^g =T-TR-INT-G.$

Total savings in the economy is thus $S=S^p+S^g =Y+NFP-C-G,$

which with the expenditure identity Y + C + I + G + NX implies that $S = I + NX + NFP,$

or, given that NX + NFP is the current account surplus (CA), $S = I + CA.$

That is:

- Investment is funded through savings, net of resources going overseas, or
- wealth, which is the accrued value of past savings, is accumulated by investment and current account surpluses, which are claims on foreigners.

[An exercise: Question 11 on page 88 in Williamson](Macroecono%20b1c08/An%20exercis%206065e.md)

## Labour Market Measure

The base population we consider when looking at the labor market is the working age population (those age 15-64 in the definition of the OECD).

People in the working age population belong to one of the 3 following categories:

1. Employed: people working (at least a given number of hours in a given period) - denote by e the number of employed workers.
2. Unemployed: people not employed (or working less than a certain number of hours on a given period) but actively looking for a job - denote by u the number of unemployed workers;
3. Out of the labor force: people neither employed nor actively looking for a job - denoted by n their number. People who are either employed or unemployed are considered to be in the labor force.

Base on our defnition and notation we have that:

- Working age population = e + u + n;
- Laborforce = e+u;

Here are three very commonly used ratios:

- Labor force participation rate = (e + u)/(e + u + n);
- employment to population ratio = e/(e + u + n);
- Unemployment rate = u/(e + u).

### Measurement issues

Not always easy to get accurate data - for instance, in many countries one has to rely on surveys, which means:

- We use a sample and not the whole population (how representative is the sample?), and
- The quality of the data depends on the accuracy of answers.

Distinguishing between different states is not always easy, in particular between u and n:

- incentive to declare oneself unemployed is linked to eligibility to UI benefits, especially for older workers;
- same issue for retirement in countries with no institutional pension system;

Similarly, the boundary between u and e is not straightforward: How to classify underemployed workers, i.e., workers employed but working
less hours than desired?

Getting a good picture of the health of the labor market requires looking at more than just one statistics.

- The labor force participation rate is also be important, although typically less looked at.

- The most popular pieces of data are:
    - the unemployment rate (rather than employment rate because it fluctuates very little over the business cycle) for a given period;
    - the net number of job created over a given period;
    - the average number of hours worked for employed workers;
    - the average wage rate (like the hourly wage).

The evolution of all labor market data can depend both on cyclical changes in economic conditions and structural changes, like changes
in the demographics.

- Teasing out each reason is not a simple task.

- For instance, the participation rate can decline because
    - economic conditions worsen and/or
    - population is ageing, leading to a larger share of retired persons in the overall population (in practice some people retire before the official retirement age and the labor force participation rate is lower for older workers).
