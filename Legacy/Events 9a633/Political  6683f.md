## Reading Questions

- [ ]  Richard Ashcraft, ‚ÄúPolitical Theory and the Problem of Ideology‚Äù, The Journal of Politics, 42 (1980) (e-Learn).
- [ ]  Loubna El Amine, ‚ÄúBeyond East and West: Reorienting Political Theory through the Prism of Modernity,‚Äù Perspectives on Politics 14 (2016) (e-Learn).

[According to Richard Ashcraft, what is wrong with a purely philosophical (i.e. abstract) conception of political theory? Why should we instead conceive political theory as political ideology?](Political%20%206683f/According%20%2029e85.md)

- How does Loubna El Amine define what she calls the ‚Äúmodernity package‚Äù (107)? Why does it make more sense to study political ideas along the ‚Äúmodern/premodern‚Äù axis rather than the ‚ÄúEast/West‚Äù divide?

# Lecture

[POSC 219, week 1 lecture.3gp](Political%20%206683f/POSC_219_week_1_lecture.3gp)

- What is political theory and why does it matter?
    - Political theory as a field of inquiry and academic discipline
        
        ## Political theory as a field of inquiry
        
        - Subfield of political science; a specialized activity of research and teaching  (narrow definition)
        - **Cardinal themes.** Study of political ideologies: liberalism, republicanism, conservatism, fascism, feminism, anarchism, racism, etc
        
        How does Political Theory differ from other subfields like philosophy, ethics, social inquiries?
        
        - Focus on key political concepts models, and theories: how and why they are defined in certain ways and not in others
            - While other subfields tend to attempt a measurement of the causal loops they explore, political theory is interested fundamentally in the models, concepts and theories themselves
                - E.g. IR: how does RoL lead to democratisation? PT: what do we mean by RoL and democratisation? Why do we mean that when we speak of these variables?
            - Exploration of open-ended, normative, contentious questions: What is justice? What are the legitimate limits to personal liberty? How much inequality is justified amongst citizens?
                - Inherently contested topics
                - Does not have empiracle answers
                - Not as descriptive, but instead, normative in some questions
        - Stakes of training in political theory: intellectual discipline, critical capacity
            - Clear, coherent, and consistent use of key political concepts
                - e.g. democracy ‚â† capitalism
            - Awareness of the multiple and contested definitions of key concepts
            - Learning about different perspectives on major political and social issues; formulating different and better questions
            - Reflecting on the tacit assumptions behind your own (and others‚Äô) political ideas, arguments, and values
                - e.g. nation is a new technology, empires, tribes etc may have been the default instead.
                - individual self interest hasn't always been an economic constant
        - ‚ÄúTraining‚Äù intellectual faculties / analytical skills by exercising them on contending theories (vs. ‚Äúlearning‚Äù by absorbing new information)

    - Political theory as political ideology
        - Political ideology: broad and relatively coherent system of meaning, value, and belief
            - Descriptive and normative: how does the world work / is ought to work?
            - Limits of the imaginable, possible, desirable, feasible
        - Political theory as part and parcel of political ideology (Richard Ashcraft)
        - Key issues and questions central to political theory (e.g.):
            - Source of political legitimacy (why do people consent to / obey authority?)
                - Provision of welfare
                - Representative
                - Religion
                - Rule of Law
                - ...
            - Key boundaries: public/private, politics/economy, state/society, ‚Ä¶
                - Central banks and other grey areas
            - Ends and means of politics: agendas of preservation and change; acceptable methods of pursuing them
                - Necessarily normative
                - What defines what is desirable
                - What is within human agents' control
        - Political ideology and empirical issues (e.g.):
            - Citizenship rights, national security measures
            - Housing, education, healthcare, welfare policies
            - Constitutions, institutional design, central/local powers
            - Social classes, party politics, social movements
            - Role of expertise vs. participation in political decisions
        
        > Aristotle: ‚Äúman is the political animal‚Äù
        > 
        - Human is endowed with language, reason, and consciousness to operate within collective existence via rules
        - Ancient greeks: political as deliberate engagement in the discussion on the drawing of the rules and customs on top which they live
            - Someone overly concerned with private affairs are called an "idiot" ‚Äî consumed by singular and narrow domain of private existence

        Conflict and cooperation inevitable; question of how to organize/regulate both 
        
        1. Politics: management of disagreement over the rules of collective life, making & changing the rules
        2. Political ideas in politics: articulating positions, expressing agreement disagreement, negotiating
        - Political ideas as a field of contestation: how to define and evaluate key concepts and distinctions
        - Boundary struggles: public / private; state / civil society; political / economic
        - Political ideas are political (i.e. non-neutral): implicit hierarchies between social groups/classes; programmes of
        distributing political, economic, and social power
        - Political ideas born of social, political, and economic conflict: historical context matters (vs. ‚Äúgreat men‚Äù story)
- Why study the Western political ideas?
    - Modernity package: modern nation-state, global capitalism
        
        ## Western or Modern
        
        - Premodern/modern vs. Western/Eastern political theory
        - Material-institutional conditions of the applicability of political ideas beyond their origin of birth
        
        $$
        ‚ÄúModernity\;package‚Äù = territorial\; sovereign\; nation-state + global \;capitalist \;economy
        $$
        
        - Modernity: 19th-century convergence of material-institutional conditions in the West & the East (Loubna El Amine):
            - Modern state: impersonal legal standing; monopoly on legitimate violence; singular & ultimate authority; institutional regulative and extractive capacity
            - Political language of the modern state: citizenship rights, constitutionalism, equality before the law, popular sovereignty
            - common reference points despite disagreements of definition & interpretation
        - Modern territorial state: born in late-18th century Europe, adopted by non-European polities in the 19th and 20th centuries (‚Äúmodernization‚Äù projects)
        - Transformation in political, institutional structures = transformation in the language of politics (think institutional hardware/ideological software)
        
        <aside>
        üí° Why focus on post-Hobbes/ Locke? Why should global capitalist economy be part of the modernity package?
        
        </aside>
        
        - Global circulation, adoption, and use of Western political concepts that emerges with modernity
            - Capitalist social relations: born in the Atlantic region in the late-17th century; penetrating Asia in the 18th & 19th (post-Hobbes)
            - State-capital symbiosis: demand for resources & manpower; centralized revenue collection; revolution in property, trade, and labor systems
            - Europe‚Äôs industrial-military ascendancy: predatory expansion; colonialism and imperialism
        - Non-European reaction: adoption of the modern state form and industrial-capitalist economy
    - Language of modern politics and its geographic mobility
        - Context of political ideas in this course: the world of modern state-capital alliance. E.g.:
        - Hobbes, Locke: clash b/w landed & commercial interests in England; absolutist vs. limited govt. doctrines
        - Marx, Mill: industrial capitalism in Europe; mass society; worker class agitation; communism, liberalism
        - Outside Europe: republicanism in Latin America(Bolivar); liberalism in India (Tagore); nationalism in China (Sun Yat-Sen); communism in China (Mao) and Russia (Lenin)
        - Post-modernity?
        - Territorial sovereign state and global capitalism in place
        - Political language of rights, law, sovereignty
        - Trump (‚Äúbringing back the jobs‚Äù); Brexit (‚Äútaking back control‚Äù), CCP (‚Äúthe Chinese dream‚Äù).
