## Main Concepts

1. 

# Mill’s times and context

Intellectual context: utilitarianism (Jeremy Bentham, James Mill)

- Pleasure and pain calculus
- Legal positivism
- Greatest happiness of the greatest number

Mill’s qualified utilitarianism:

- Ancient influence: good life as human flourishing
- Modern influence: individual autonomy
- Liberty, individuality, social utility intertwined

Industrial capitalism, urbanization, mass society

- Literacy, popular press, public opinion
- Working–class demand for political enfranchisement
- A new threat: “tyranny of the majority”
- Problem of liberal democracy: reconciling popular power and individual liberty

On Liberty as a manifesto of liberalism

- Problem: limits of legal and moral compulsion over individual thought and practice
- Thesis: absolute liberty of the individual in the “self-regarding” domain
    - i.e. short of injuring others: “harm principle”

# Principle of individuality

Individuality: highest ethical principle; end in itself

- “Good life”: cultivation individual faculties (reason, passion, and impulse)
- Eudaemonic (vs. hedonistic) pleasures
- Independent exercise of faculties: experience, reflection, judgment

# Freedom and unfreedom

Freedom as condition of/means to individuality

- Positive liberty (vs. custom, habit, dogma)
- Negative liberty (vs. political & social pressure)
- Key liberties: thought & expression; lifestyle; association

Unfreedom: conformity to prevailing norms/custom (voluntary or forced, the same)

- Limits to liberty: harm principle; offense ≠ injury
- Threats to liberty:
    - Moralism: charges of immorality, error, offensiveness
    - Paternalism: charges of ignorance of one’s interests

# Marketplace of ideas

Liberal faith in deliberation and debate

- Truth from reasoned agreement/disagreement
- “Unreason”: custom/tradition (Burke), the will of the sovereign (Hobbes, Rousseau)
- Unreasoned opinion/belief: dogma, prejudice

- Faculty of reason: basis of human perfectibility
- Discovery of truth: questioning, falsification, correction, completion
- Collective exercise of reason: disagreement, debate, deliberation
- Political, social, moral affairs by definition contentious

Subjective dispositions of liberal deliberation

- Scrutinizing one’s own opinions / dominant views of one’s own milieu
- Impartial consideration of opposing views; readiness to be persuaded
- Countenancing “extreme’ views

Objective conditions of liberal deliberation

- Legal protections for liberty of opinion and expression (press, associations)
- Diversity of opinion and lifestyles (liberal pluralism)
- Warding of assumptions of “infallibility” or “socially useful” ideas

# Liberty and utility

Liberty → individuality (creativity, originality) → social utility (improvement, reform, progress)

- Individuality: experimentation, creation, invention
- Diversity: disagreement, correction, progress
- Persons of genius; pioneers of mankind

Suppression of opinion, prescription of belief: unfair to the individual, harmful to society

- Censorship as public injury: “robbing the human race” of the benefits of liberty
- The West : liberty, diversity, dynamism
- The East: tyranny, uniformity, stagnation

# Tyranny of the majority

> “Freedom of opinion does not exist in America.” Alexis de Tocqueville
> 

Modern mass society: “collective mediocrity”

- Education, communication, commerce: social and ideational leveling; uniformity and conformity
- A new despotism: public opinion of “average men”
- Suffocation of individuality, spontaneity, creativity
- Europe becoming more “Chinese”

Paradox (?): “tyranny” under a democratic republic founded on equality, liberty, and popular sovereignty

- Extreme leveling tendencies: idol of equality
- Sanctity of majority rule in constitution and morals
- No independent basis for dissent to majority opinion

Majority/minority as a political distinction (cf. Aristotle)

- Absolute power of the majority greater than absolute power of kings
- Sanctity of “the people”; pandering to the masses
- Public pressure: enslavement of the mind; self-censorship; “perfect despotism”

# Liberalism v. Democracy

- Decentralization as a limit on power: multiple, counteracting centers of influence
- Modernity: dissolution of inherited hierarchies; political equality; loss of intermediary bodies of power
- New political pluralism: civil society, voluntary associations, free press, political parties

Constitutionalism as a liberal principle: check on power

- Constitutional monarchies → constitutional democracies
- Subjective rights: protection of minorities from the tyranny of the majority
- Problem of liberal democracy: limits to popular sovereignty
