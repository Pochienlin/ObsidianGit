# In-class exercise 6

The Ex6 folder contains three webpages:

- Home – mainly text based
- Register – a registration form for a user
- Feedback – a form which allows a user to submit feedback

Beautify these pages (the best you can) with the help of internal/external style sheets. You are free to add in pictures too. Your pages do not have to look like the ones on the right.
