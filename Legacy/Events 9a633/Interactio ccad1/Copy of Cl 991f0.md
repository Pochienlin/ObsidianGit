**Why** open-ended questions are better?

- But not all open-ended questions are good
- “Tell me a story about yourself”
    
    This rarely works, as most of us can’t quickly come up with stories about ourselves that are appropriate for just any situation. When you ask this, people might stammer for 45 seconds, and then give you a story that is not all that interesting (and possibly rehearsed).
    
    - Some open-ended questions gives you **summaries**
    
    Q: “How do you start your day?”
    
    A: “I guess I just come in and check my messages.”
    
    Q: “Tell me about the beginning of your day”
    
    A: “First I hang up my coat, then I start my computer.
    
    Actually, even before that I’ll see if my boss has left me something on my chair. If he has, that’s first priority. While the computer’s coming up, I check the answering machine for urgent messages. There aren't any. Then I look to see if there’s a fax that has to be handled right away. Nope, none today. If there were, I’d take it right in and put it on…”

**When** are open-ended questions bad?

**What** are some good open-ended questions?

- Good questions are open-ended.
- Most of us are uncomfortable if we ask someone a question and get silence.
- Don’t be afraid of silence. Let it happen. Sometimes people have to think before responding. When people start talking, you’ll learn a lot.
- Examples
    - Bad: “Do you exercise regularly?” (“Yes” or “No” doesn’t tell you much)
    - A little better: “How often do you exercise in a week?” (People may answer “a lot.”)
    - Much better: “When was the last time you exercised.”
    - Excellent: “Tell me about the last time you exercised.”
    - Excellent: “Tell me about the next time you’re going to exercise.”
