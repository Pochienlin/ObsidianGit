# Activity

- Read the Mini Case: Categories of enterprise applications and answer the following question
- Examine the characteristics/attributes of the different applications and group them into the following three different categories
    - Commercial-Off-The-Shelf
    - Custom
    - Legacy
- Identify the key characteristics/attributes that differentiate the three different categories
- Discuss possible pros and cons of using applications of different categories in supporting business processes

| Category | Pros                                                                                 | Cons                                                                                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| COTS     | Relatively low cost, vendor support, fast to implement (not always), well documented | Lack of customisability, lack of control, expensive, potentially irrelevant or limited functionality |
| Custom   | Suited to the company‚Äôs needs, unique, support available                             | Development lead time, relatively expensive, maintenance cost                                        |
| Legacy   | Familiar, stable, low cost                                                           | Hard to scale, outdated/old, not supported or less supported, incompatible                           |

## Defining the categories
### What does Legacy mean?
###### Old? They don‚Äôt have to be
Legacy systems are those that are not supported well. Old apps tend to be legacies but new tech can be legacy as well.
- E.g. the entire dev team terminated contract

###### Vendor $\cap$ Legacy
- E.g. Vendor goes bankrupt

###### Vendor $\cap$ Customised
- E.g. Plug-ins

###### Custom $\cap$ Dev. from scratch‚Äô
- E.g. Adapted from another system

Sometimes legacy systems persist because of a ‚Äúripple effect‚Äù ‚Üí many things are built upon it.
- Or, people are resistant to change
