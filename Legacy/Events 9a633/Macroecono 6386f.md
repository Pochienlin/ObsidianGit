# Introduction

We now have all we need to build our static general equilibrium model, that is, our first macro model.

The first aim of this part is to characterise the equilibrium of this economy, that is, we need to find the conditions under which the household’s and firm’s decisions are consistent with each other, given the government decisions.

The conditions here, as almost always in models like ours, are about "prices" or relative "prices," and here there is only one, the wage rate w.

Once this is done we can use our static macro model to analyze a number of questions, like:

- What happens if TFP z improves?
- What happens if the government increases its expenditures G?

# The Government

- Our static macro model is populated by 3 agents, (1) a representative household and (2) a representative firm, who are as studied earlier, and...
- ...(3) a government whose behavior is taken as given, that is, it is not a optimizing agent.
- We nonetheless still need to make sure the government’s decisions are feasible and are rational (i.e., not clearly suboptimal), for otherwise they would not be credible.
- The government’s chooses its expenditures G and taxes. For simplicity we first assume for the most part that taxes are lump sums and levied on the household only.

How does the government funds its expenditures G?

- With (lump-sum) taxes T and the two are thus linked through the government’s budget constraint.
- We assume the government balances its budget, that is G = T , for any other assumption is either infeasible or suboptimal.
    - Assume G > T : This is not feasible because the government is spending resources it does not have (but this can be feasible with several periods because issuing debt to borrow becomes possible).
    - Assume G < T : This is suboptimal because the government is wasting resources by taxing more than it needs.

# Definitions

The rep. household demands goods C and supplies labor Ns:

- In an economy with I households  $C(w;\overrightarrow{\pi-T})=\sum c_i(w_i;\pi_i -T_i)$ and $N^S (w;\overrightarrow{\pi-T})=\sum [h-l_i(w;\pi_i -T_i)].$
- In our economy $C(w;{\pi-T})=c(w;{\pi-T})$ and $N^s$= $(w ; \pi - T ) = h - l (w ; \pi - T ).$

The rep. firm supplies goods Y s and demands labor Nd :

- In an economy with J firms  $Y^s(w;\overrightarrow z ) = \sum y_j(w;z_j)$ and $N^d(w;\overrightarrow z ) = \sum n^f_j(w;z_j)$
- In our economy $Y^s(w;z) = y(w;z)$ and $N^d(w;z) = n^f (w;z).$

The government demands goods G.

There are therefore 2 markets in our model, one for the consumption good and the other one for labor.

The economy is in equilibrium if and only if both markets clear (hence, it is general equilibrium):

- labor market:$N^s=N^d$,and
- goods market: $Y^s=C+G.$

From **Walras’ law** we know that if one market clears, then the other one also clears.

How do we ensure both markets clear? The wage rate, which is the only relative price, adjusts.

# Graphical Representation

The graphical representation of the HH’s problem considers the quantities of leisure and of the consumption of the good,

while the graphical representation of the firm’s problem considers the quantity of labor input and of output.

A unified graphical representation necessitates to choose the same variables, and we use leisure and the consumption good.

We can thus use the graphical representation of the HH’s problem we used earlier on.

For the firm we can no longer use the production function and instead we use the Production Possibility Frontier (PPF), which is the combinations of leisure and of consumption good that are feasible given the aggregate production function.

## The PPF

![Untitled](Macroecono%206386f/Untitled%202.png)

The PPF is essentially the production function represented as a function of leisure instead of labor, i.e., its mirror image,...

... and takes into account that the government demands G units of the good no matter what:

I implying the firm needs to produce at least G units of the good,

I which means leisure cannot be more than the quantity $l^{max}(G)$ such that $zF(\bar K,l^{max}(G)) = G.$

Note that since output Y s is also the total income of the HH (labor income and dividends), the HH’s income is just enough to cover its tax liabilities if it works $h - l^{max}(G)$ units.

This also confirms the HH does not get to consume if it chooses leisure $l^{max}(G)$.
