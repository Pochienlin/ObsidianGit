# **Design Thinking - Developing Empathy**

## Activity: Why is this trucker‚Äôs device not user friendly?

- Big fingers vs. small buttons
- Screen/keys not back-lit ‚Üí hard at night or in tunnels etc
- Too many options: recall over recognition
- Winter: not gloves friendly
- Stylus is on far right ‚Üí Hard to reach

# Developing Empathy - Approaches

> The ability to understand and share the feelings of another
> 

Empathy is the foundation of human-centered design process

- Observe by viewing users and their behavior
- Engage by interviewing and learning from users
- Immerse into what your user experience

Outcome: Inspire new thinking by discovering what people really need

# **Developing Empathy - Observations**

![Untitled](Product%20Ma%204f675/Untitled%202.png)

**Iceberg theory** in psychology is to say that we only deal with that which we perceive with the naked eye.

- The rest goes unnoticed, which can be compared with an iceberg.
- There is a conscious part of the information, but there is also another unconscious part underneath.

### Example: Milkshakes

> "Most of them, it turned out, bought [the milkshake] to do a similar job," he writes. "They faced a long, boring commute and needed something to keep that extra hand busy and to make the commute more interesting. 

They weren't yet hungry, but knew that they'd be hungry by 10 a.m.; they wanted to consume something now that would stave off hunger until noon. And they faced constraints: They were in a hurry, they were wearing work clothes, and they had (at most) one free hand.‚Äù

# **Developing Empathy - Immersion**

![Untitled](Product%20Ma%204f675/Untitled%203.png)

### Tacit knowledge

- Knowledge that results from internalized information and experiences and is difficult to explicate in a formal way
- Knowledge and skills not documented
Examples
- Culinary experience
- Agile methodology - "Agile methods derive much of their agility by relying on the tacit knowledge embodied in the team, rather than writing the knowledge down in plans.‚Äù Barry Boehm

# **Developing Empathy - Engaging**

Learning from Users 

- Well known rules or defined workflow
- Easy to discover (usually documented) Learning from the Practice

Learning from the Process

- How people handle situations when rules fail (workarounds and hacks)
- Experts knowing when to break the rules
- Edge cases are hard to discover, but equally important

# **Developing Empathy - Mental model**

Mental model

- What the user believes about the system at hand - Jacob Nielsen
- An explanation of someone's thought process about how something works in the real world - Wikipedia

Conceptual model

- A high-level description of how an application or system) is organized and operates.
- ‚ÄúThe intended user‚Äôs model.‚Äù

The great interaction design problem

- Designer‚Äôs mental model becomes a conceptual model for the system
- Gaps may form between conceptual model and users‚Äô mental models

### Example: Hotel or flight important?

Left: flight-driven

Right: Hotel-driven

![Untitled](Product%20Ma%204f675/Untitled%204.png)

A Conceptual Model specifies

- Objects exposed to users
- Actions user can perform on each object
- Attributes (user visible) of each object
- Relationships between objects
- type hierarchies (inheritance)
- part/whole (containment)
- Is a mental model/ conceptual model self-reinforcing?
    
    Yes ‚Üí after it gains traction, it tends to become more embedded within structure
    
    - E.g. self-hailing rides
    
    No or not really ‚Üí mental models are changed over time via gradual adaptation, adoption and acceptance
    

## Behavioural traits are not mental models

Examples

1. ... interviewees don‚Äôt bother to spend time socializing with complete strangers
2. ... believe that the application will be difficult to learn... and tough to navigate
3. ... some people prefer to stick with existing services which they have been using for a period...

```python
Construct: <the goal> + <the method>
```

1. One way to get a taxi is to try hailing for one on the streets
2. To recover from cough, drink lots of water and get plentiful rest
3. The spreadsheet is the best tool to store data in a structured way
4. Cloud storage is most effective because data is accessible everywhere

### Example: Refrigerator from hell

Dissonance between conceptual/implementation and user‚Äôs mental model

Inside this refrigerator there are two dials. Dial R, the ‚Äúrefrigerator‚Äù dial, ranges from 1 to 9 (9 is the coldest). Dial F, the ‚Äúfreezer‚Äù dial, ranges from A to E (E is the coldest). It takes about 24 hours for the temperature to settle to a new level after you change a setting.

- Turning dial R to setting 9 causes both the refrigerator and the freezer to become colder.
- Turning dial F to setting E causes the refrigerator to become warmer.

# Challenges - Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation

Norman‚Äôs Action Cycle

1. Intention
2. Action Specification
3. Input devices
4. Physical System
5. Interface display
6. Interpretation
7. Evaluation

The **gulf of execution** occurs between steps 1-3

An issue with 4 is a system bug

The **gulf of evaluation** occurs between steps 5-7

A **mistake** happens at steps 1 and 7

A **slip** happens between steps 2-6

Reduce Gulf of Execution by making it easier to:

- Determine the function of the device
- Tell what actions are possible
- Mapping: intention ‚Üí physical movement
- Allow user to perform the action
Reduce Gulf of Evaluation by making it easier to:
- Tell what state the system is in
- Mapping system state ‚Üí interpretation
- Remember the desired system state

# Interviews

> a meeting of people face to face, especially for consultation - planned communication with a purpose
> 

Objective

- To learn about interviewee‚Äôs thinking (understanding, perceptions etc)
- Notes:
    - information exchanged need not be limited to facts
    - outcomes of an interview as meaning and understanding are oftentimes more significant than objective factual statements

### Types of interviews

- General, e.g. employment
- Research (academic)
- Government, social
- Business, management, e.g. brand, market

| Preparation | Execution | Review |
| --- | --- | --- |
| - ¬†Interview schedule
- Who, why, when and where | - Interview guides
- What are the questions
- Conducting the interview
- Rapport, structure, listen, clarify | - Interview notes format
   - ¬†What information was extracted
   - ¬†Decisions, actions |
| - Identify objectives and information required
- Identify the interviewee
- Create interview schedule and session plan
- Prepare consent documentation
- Book schedule | - Interview guides ensures focus, efficiency, consistency and comparison | -¬†Qualitative analysis, e.g. transcribing, clustering, coding
-¬†Compare notes |

## Open questions

‚ÄúHow do you feel about the system?‚Äù

### Advantages

- Provides assurance to interviewees
- Creates interest and curiosity
- Opens possibilities and depth

### Disadvantages

- Losing focus on topic and objective
- Losing time
- Creating sense of loss in interviewee
- Low reliability of data

---

## Closed questions

‚ÄúWas the UI pleasing to you?‚Äù

### Advantages

- Efficient answer, saves time
- Easy information processing - Little interview skills required

### Disadvantages

- Does not stimulate interest and depth from users
- Lack of resolution or qualification in answers
- Narrow focus

| Dos | Do Nots |
| --- | --- |
| - Create rapport, break ice
- Smile
- Be objective
- Avoid biased questions
- Clarify and verify when needed
- Guide interviewee along topic
- Be polite and respectful
- Listen! | - Forget interviewee‚Äôs name
- Criticise
- Interrupt
- Be impatient
- Appear bored (body language)
- Impose or push your view |

Close first? Open first? Sandwiching?

# Execution

[How to do a research interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9t-_hYjAKww)

- Issues
    1. No rapport
    2. No brief on what the interview is about 
    3. No engagement with the interviewee: Overusing strictly closed questions
    4. No follow up and context preceding and succeeding the closed question
    5. Functions more like a survey
    6. Awkward silences/ demanding tone (‚Äùsit down‚Äù)
    7. Environment not very welcoming 

[How to do a user interview (from Google Ventures updated)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qq3OiHQ-HCU&feature=youtu.be)

- Tips
    1. Friendly welcome: why are they here, set the tone, set expectation and agenda
        1. ‚ÄúThank you so much for helping me‚Äù
        2. ‚ÄúWhat I want to do today is to test the design, not you, I just want to know if this design makes sense‚Äù
        3. ‚Äúthis is kind of casual‚Äù
    2. Finding out their background: Engage in light conversation to open them up | 10min
        1. ‚ÄúWhat do you do?... Oh, that sounds like a lot to do‚Äù
        2. ‚ÄúAnd what do you do to keep yourself refreshed on the weekends?‚Äù 
        3. Set a safe environment
    3. Bring out the prototype
        1. ‚Äúsome things might work and some things might not, there‚Äôs no way to break it‚Äù
        2. ‚ÄúThere is no right or wrong answers‚Äù
        3. Immerse: from the background, borrow mental models they‚Äôre familiar with to explain 

<aside>
üí° Successful interviewing is both an art and a science

</aside>

- Set clear objectives and goals
- Prepare the questions and the order you will ask
- Get background of users and set up context properly
- Anticipate responses by rehearsing
- Construct follow-up questions
- Learn from previous mistakes, rinse-and-repeat

# Personas

Personas are fictional characters, which you create based upon your research in order to represent the different user types that might use your service, product, site, or brand in a similar way. Creating personas will help you to understand your users‚Äô needs, experiences, behaviours and goals.

Personas are composited based on real data collected from multiple individuals. Personas add the dimension of human touch to what would largely remain cold facts in research.

Creating persona profiles of typical or atypical users can help you to understand patterns in your research, which synthesises the types of people you seek to design for. Personas are also known as model characters or composite characters.

## **Goal-directed persona**

focuses on: What does my typical user want to do with my product?‚Äù. The objective of a goal-directed persona is to examine the process and workflow that your user would prefer to utilise in order to achieve their objectives in interacting with your product or service.

![Untitled](Product%20Ma%204f675/Untitled%208.png)

## Empathy Maps

An empathy map is a collaborative visualisation used to articulate what we know about a particular type of user. 

It **externalises knowledge** about users in order to 

1. create a shared understanding of user needs, and 
2. aid in decision making.

![Untitled](Product%20Ma%204f675/Untitled%209.png)

### Benefits of empathy map

- Remove bias from our designs and align the team on a single, shared understanding of the user
- Discover weaknesses in our research
- Uncover user needs that the user themselves may not even be aware of
- Understand what drives users‚Äô behaviors
- Guide us towards meaningful innovation

[Examples: Jill vs. Diane](Product%20Ma%204f675/Examples%20J%2095067.md)

## Archetypes vs. Persona

Archetypes are one level of abstraction above, whereas persona are quite concrete

> **Personas** help us understand who customers are today. 
**Archetypes** show us who they want to be. 
Taking both perspectives helps drive both strategic vision and operational plans.
> 

Is there only one persona?
