# Secularism and realism

- Realism: power vs. morality; reality vs. ideals
- Pragmatism: timeless principles vs. relative situations
- Secularism:
    - Knowledge: history and example vs. natural laws and eternal truths
    - Legitimacy: force and habit vs. tradition and religion
- Force/*virt√∫* and *fortuna;* man vs. fate
- Skill, strength, cunning, courage, intellect
- Man and beast; lion and fox
- Gendered politics: *virt√∫* and manliness

# Ends and Means

- ‚ÄúThe ends justify the means‚Äù
- Cruelty, ‚Äúwicked actions,‚Äù and ‚Äúnot to be good‚Äù
- Assassination, lying, breaking promises, deceit
- Affects of power: love, fear, and hate
- Wicked humans, capricious world
