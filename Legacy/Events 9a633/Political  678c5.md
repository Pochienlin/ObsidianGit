# State of nature and the ‚Äúnoble savage‚Äù

> ‚ÄúThere was neither education nor progress; generations were multiplied to no purpose. ‚Ä¶ centuries went by with all the crudeness of the first ages; the species was already old, and man remained ever a child.‚Äù
> 

Inequality by definition social/artificial

State of nature: asocial, solitary, animalistic

Absence of language, interaction, property

Instinct (vs. reason) : self-preservation and compassion (pity)

Peace and tranquility

# Society, property, inequality

Republican: rests on civic duty

Modern: inclusion via social contract and not natural hierarchy 

The ‚Äúfall‚Äù from the natural state

Cooperation, interdependence, associations

Honing of rational (abstract/instrumental) faculties

Invention of property

Egotism and alienation (vs. compassion)

Quest for wealth, reputation, power

Inequality, competition, rivalry, conflict

Civil society born of social conflict (haves and have-nots)

> ‚Äú‚Ä¶competition and rivalry on the one hand, and opposition of interests on the other, and always the hidden desire of profit at the expense of someone else. All these ills are the first effect of property and the inseparable offshoot of incipient inequality‚Äù

# Critique of liberal government

Protection of property = protection of the wealthy; legalization of force and theft

> [Thus the poor] ‚Äúall ran to chain themselves, in the belief that they secured their liberty ‚Ä¶ Such was, or should have been the origin of society and laws, which gave new fetters to the weak and new forces to the rich, irretrievably destroyed natural liberty, established forever the law of property and inequality ‚Ä¶ and for the profit of a few ambitious men henceforth subjected the entire human race to labor, servitude, and misery‚Äù
> 

Liberal peace/security = voluntary servitude

> ‚ÄúI know that enslaved peoples do nothing but boast of the peace and tranquillity they enjoy in their chains and that they give the name peace to the most miserable slavery‚Äù
> 

# Civil constitution and body politic

1. Moral vs. instinctual: State of nature is amoral
2. Duty vs. impulse
3. Right vs. appetite
4. Reason vs. inclination
5. Freedom vs. unfreedom
6. Citizen vs. private person
7. Common interest vs. private interest
8. General will vs. particular will / will of all

[In-class](Political%20%20678c5/In-class%20f8bfa.md)

‚ÄúCivil constitutionalism‚Äù

- Original constitution as the source of right, authority, duty, legitimacy
- Force vs. authority; might vs. right; fact vs. morality; is vs. ought
- Original civil act (social compact): foundation of society

[In-class](Political%20%20678c5/In-class%2073941.md)

Total alienation of rights to the community

- Political & legal equality: no special rights / privileges
- Political society: condition of property and ‚Äúmoral freedom‚Äù
- Freedom as autonomy (non-domination): self-mastery, self-government
- ‚ÄúWhat man acquires in civil state is moral liberty, which alone makes him truly master of himself‚Ä¶‚Äù (p. 151)

# General will and sovereignty

- General will: moral will of the community
- Thinking and judging as a citizen: ‚Äúwhat is in the common good?‚Äù
    - vs. private person: ‚Äúwhat is in it for me?
- Singular, unitary, collective (quasi-Platonic notion)
- The ‚Äúcommon element‚Äù across plurality of wills/interests (p. 151)

Popular sovereignty: exercise of general will

- Convention, deliberation, judgment, making laws (auto-nomia)
- Sovereignty unlimited, inalienable, indivisible, infallible
- The paradox of ‚Äúforced to be free‚Äù
- Obedience to general will as the condition of equality and autonomy
- Dual status in the state: citizen (active), subject (passive)

Natural jurisprudence: natural liberty, natural equality, social contract

- Republican revival: civic duty, political participation, public spirit
- Break with liberalism (individualism, materialism)
- Good life (liberty, autonomy, activity) vs. mere life (peace, comforts, security)
- Emancipation (vs. restraint) through laws
- Direct participation vs. representative government

# Democratic republicanism

Practical conditions of the virtuous republic

- Size: face-to-face interaction; visibility; accountability; assembly
- Education: formation of character; public spirit and patriotic commitment
- Socioeconomic equality: moderate and egalitarian property

# Rousseau and popular sovereignty

Critique of liberal contractualism: inequality, domination, false freedoms

- Republican contractualism / democratic republicanism
- Theory of popular sovereignty: universal equality, collective autonomy, the ‚Äúwill of the people‚Äù

# Conundrums of popular sovereignty

- Defining ‚Äúthe people‚Äù:
    - Criteria of inclusion/exclusion?
    - Who sets the criteria?
- Identifying the general will
    - Ultimate yet unclear source of political legitimacy
    - Who speaks in the name of the people?

# Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) What is enlightenment?

Glorification of reason (vs. received wisdom, tradition, authority)

- ‚ÄúEmancipation from self-incurred immaturity‚Äù
- Maturity = autonomy, responsibility
- Enlightenment as orientation, discipline, process (vs. knowledge, truth, etc)

Politics of Enlightenment: criticizing established authority

- Tradition, custom, habit, status quo: unfreedom
- Human progress: improvement of ideas and institutions
- Progress through reason: expression and exchange of ideas
- Public and private enlightenment: liberating minds (esp. from religious dogma), liberating societies

[In-class](Political%20%20678c5/In-class%20c37ad.md)

- Reconciling progress and order: public vs. private use of reason
- Public use of reason (active): dissemination of ideas
    - Bourgeois ‚Äúpublic sphere‚Äù: print medium, private gatherings
- Private use of reason (passive): duties to the state
    - Change through persuasion and legislation (vs. disobedience)

Political authority and enlightenment

- Progress through reason as human nature/calling
- Political restraints on the public use of reason illegitimate
- Duty to protect the public use of reason from public and private censorship
- Enlightened despotism: ‚Äúargue as much as you want but obey‚Äù
