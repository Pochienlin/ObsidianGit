- Colonialism and modern racism
- Gandhi, British Empire, and non-violence
- Fanon, French Empire, and violence

## Main Concepts

1. 

# Race and the paradox of universalism

Race: delimiting the politically relevant universe (the community of equals)

- Racism: exclusion based on belief in the innate inferiority of a group
- Doctrines and attitudes; laws and policies; prejudices and practices
- Race as a social construct: arbitrary, circumstantial markers of difference

Racism as a system of power

- Material: distribution of resources and positions ‚Äì class (e.g. racialized labor)
- Legal: formal rights or their exercise ‚Äì citizenship (e.g. ‚Äúsecond-class citizens‚Äù)
- Symbolic: self-worth, dignity ‚Äì identity (e.g. ‚Äúseparate but equal‚Äù = unequal)

# Colonialism and Racism

Modern European colonialism (16th-20th century) and the birth of racism as a political language (18th-20th century)

- Construction of European ‚Äúwhiteness‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-whiteness‚Äù
- Hierarchical ordering of social difference: white, yellow, red, brown, black
- Military, political, economic dominance: race as a narrative of superiority

Racial binaries: reason/passion, virtue/effeminacy, industry/sloth, freedom/servility, progress/stagnation‚Ä¶

- Racism as imperial ideology: enslaving irrational blacks, expropriating savage Indians, dominating servile Asiatics
- Scientific racism: from monogenesis and differentiation to polygenesis and biological difference

Anti-colonialism and repudiation of racism

- Western civilization as barbarism: conquest, exploitation, corruption
- The colonized as the true bearers of universal ideals
- Claims to moral worth, dignity, equality, autonomy
- Violent and non-violent anti-colonialism: Fanon and Gandhi

# Gandhi, British Empire, and non-violence

<aside>
üí° Satyagraha, or "holding firmly to truth", or "truth force", is a particular form of nonviolent resistance or civil resistance. Someone who practises satyagraha is a satyagrahi

1919 Rowlatt Act, and Satyagraha in India

Gandhi on self-rule (Swaraj):

- Religious toleration
- Non-violent resistance (Satyagraha)
- Self-sufficiency (Swadeshi)

Colonialism and racism inherently unjust: civilizational hierarchy; degradation and humiliation

- Countering injustice by violent and non-violent means
- Violent means counterproductive: death, pride, and future cycles of violence
- Alternative path: non-violence, soul-force

Satyagraha: non-violent disobedience to unjust laws, suffering the consequences (vs. rebellion)

- Disobedience as non-cooperation; withdrawal of consent; dissolution of authority; naked power
- Contra legal positivism: higher laws; legitimacy / legality
- Antinomian challenge to the sovereignty principle

![Untitled](Political%20%20543c8/Untitled%202.png)

Satyagraha as political strategy for self-rule

- Subjective conditions of satyagraha: faith, resolve, will, fearlessness
- The ultimate sacrifice: disobedience and martyrdom
- Effectiveness of non-violence: example of virtue, integrity, love
- Inciting shame and sympathy in the oppressors and spectators

Satyagraha as a way of life: challenging instrumental rationality (means-ends) in politics (cf. Machiavelli)

- Love, truth, wisdom: primal force of human bonds
- A new history: invisible acts of love, pity, kindness (vs. states, statesmen, power, wars)
- Cosmopolitan potential of satyagraha: from family to humanity

# Fanon, French Empire, and violence

Fanon on decolonization and racism:

- Dehumanizing violence of colonialism
- Regenerative violence of anti-colonial struggle

Colonial rule founded on violence = necessity of anti-colonial violence

- Occupation, pacification, expropriation, exploitation
- Manichean colonial ideology: civilized/barbarous, master/slave, white/black
- Bankruptcy of Enlightenment universals (liberty, equality, fraternity)

Mimetic isomorphism between colonizer & colonized; methods of colonization ‚Üí methods of decolonization

- Naivety/outrage of expecting the colonized to seek justice in the colonial system
- Anti-colonial violence: the colonized speaking back to the colonizer (‚Äúthe colonizer understands nothing but force)

Positive/constructive effects of violence

- Politicization and social integration of the colonized; recovery of a purpose and belonging
- Overcoming inferiority; recovering dignity, self-respect
- Political unity (vs. colonial strategy of divide-and-rule); common cause, ‚Äúnational front‚Äù
- Political ownership of the independent polity
