# Burke's time and context

Eighteenth-century modernity: commercialization, bureaucratization

- Rise of the middle classes, Enlightenment, secularism, natural rights discourse
- Key figure of conservatism (≠ reaction / romanticism): critique of capitalism and liberalism from the right
- Preservation of the old order under changing conditions

Burke on American and French Revolutions

- Historical rights of Englishmen vs. metaphysical rights of men
- French Revolution: world turned upside down
- Overthrow of the Ancien Régime: aristocracy, Church power/property, feudal obligations

# Individualism, reason and rights

Objection to Enlightenment belief in reason

- “We are afraid to put men to live and trade each on his own private stock of reason” (74)
- Human beings as creatures of passion, belief, and habit
- Government as a remedy to human defects
- Natural rights of men as a dangerous fiction; abstract first principles as solvent of authority

“Real rights” derived from historical associations

- Rights of Englishmen; Magna Charta; Declaration of Rights; national “patrimony”
- Constitutions, institutions, rights, and laws as “inheritance”; shared history and continuity
- “Great primeval contract” vs. radical contract theory
- Habit, trust, faith, manners; history, traditions, customs

# Authority, government and legitimacy

Main purpose of government: law and order; restraint of passions

- Inherent respect for authority as the basis of order
- Legitimate authority not from first principles (violent origins all government)
- Legitimacy from effects: security, property, protection, prosperity

Foundation of political attachment: “public affections,” sentiment, feeling (vs. reason, deliberation, persuasion)

- Embodied authority: leaders, symbols, ceremonies
- Customs, manners, affections: “tools of the politician’s trade”
- Disenchanted authority = naked power, punishment; “laws to be supported only by their own terrors”

Politics as “practical science”: prudence, caution, circumspection

- Political problems specific to context and circumstance
- Extraordinary complexity of modern societies; limits of totalizing human vision/comprehension
- Skepticism of grand political design; unintended consequences of human action

# History, Tradition, Custom

Tradition: accumulation of time-tested principles and maxims; distillation of collective experience

- “Prejudice”: embodiments of “latent wisdom”
- Status quo bias: existing institutional arrangements in place for a reason; success in addressing human wants
- Legitimacy of inequality (class, gender, birth) from history

Enlightenment disdain for tradition for its own sake: old, received, inherited

- Rationality’s own irrationality: change for change’s sake; “spirit of innovation”; destroying & starting anew
- Disregard for historical continuity and intergenerational duties

# Continuity and change

“Change to preserve”: addressing necessity/exigency in order to preserve the constitutional framework

- “A state without the means of some change is without the means of its conservation” (184)
- Gradual and cautious change: evolution, adaptation, flexibility; reform vs. revolution
- Fear of unpredictable ramifications drastic change

# Hierarchy and inequality

Authority inherently hierarchical; principle of authority and principle of equality mutually exclusive

- Natural hierarchy: “the great primeval contract linking the lower with the higher natures” (82)
- Unquestioned authority and obedience; discharging duties necessitated by one’s station in life

Nobility and clergy as the foundation of European civilization; love & fear; attachment & subordination

- Civil liberties (life, liberty, property) ≠ political liberties (political power & participation)
- “I have in my contemplation the civil social man only” (50)
- Political exclusion; fitness to rule ordained by custom, convention, wisdom, upbringing
