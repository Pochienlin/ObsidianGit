# Questions 15 and 17 on page 160 in Williamson

LO 6, 7 Supposing that a single consumer works for a firm, the quantity of labor input for the firm, N, is identical to the quantity of hours worked by the consumer, h - l. Graph the relationship be- tween output produced, Y on the vertical axis and leisure hours of the consumer, l, on the horizontal axis, which is implied by the production function of the firm. (In Chapter 5, we refer to this relationship as the production possibilities frontier.) What is the slope of the curve you have graphed?

Case 1:  production function only involves labour

In this case, product = wN, where N=h-l. The graph will this have a gradient of -w with y intercept wh and x intercept at h

Case 2: production function involves capital and labour: $Y =zF(K,h-l).$

In this case, the function will be a downwards sloping curve. The gradient would be the derivative of the product with respect to leisure, where leisure is $24-n$, which implies that the gradient would be $-MP_n$ since capital $\bar K$ is held at a constant level (i.e. first order partial derivative)

$Y = zK^{0.3}N^{0.7}$

1. If z = 1 and K = 1, graph the production function. Is the marginal product of labor positive and diminishing?
    
    $MP_n = 0.3z \bar K ^0.3 N^{-0.3}$ → Marginal product of labor is positive
    
    $Y''_{NN} = -0.09z \bar K^{0.3}N^{-1.3}$ → Marginal product of labor is diminishing

2. ??? it's still z=1 K=1 right?
    
    Reading the below seems like it's meant to be z=2 K=1...?
    
    In which case, $Y= 2N^{0.3}$ (IN BLUE) instead of $Y= N^{0.3}$ (IN RED)

3. Production is now higher at $Y= 2^{0.3}N^{0.3} \approx 1.23N^{0.3}$(IN BLUE)

4. $MP_N=z*0.7K^{0.3}N^{-0.3}$
    1. $MP_N(1,1)=0.7N^{-0.3}$
    2. $MP_N(2,1)=0.7(2)N^{-0.3}=1.4N^{-0.3}$
    3. $MP_N(1,2)=0.7(2^{0.3})N^{-0.3}\approx 0.86N^{-0.3}$
