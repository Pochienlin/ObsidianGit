- 📜 Scripture
    
    Hebrews 10:24-25
    
    > **`24`** And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, **`25`** not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching.
    > 
    
    James 5:19
    
    > `19` My brothers and sisters, if one of you should wander from the truth and someone should bring that person back, `20` remember this: Whoever turns a sinner from the error of their way will save them from death and cover over a multitude of sins.
    > 
    
    John 13:34-35
    
    > `34` “A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. `35` By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.”
    > 
    
    1 Peter 2:12
    
    > (NIV)
    12 Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us.
    (ESV)
    `12` Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable, so that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation.
    > 
    
    1 Cor 12:12-13
    
    > `12` For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. `13` For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and all were made to drink of one Spirit.
    > 
    
    Acts 1:4-8
    
    > `4` On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: “Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about. `5` For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.”
    `6` Then they gathered around him and asked him, “Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?”
    `7` He said to them: “It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority. `8` But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”
    > 
    
    1 Peter 3:21 
    
    > `21` Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a **good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,** `22` who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him.
    > 
    
    Acts 4:29-31
    
    > `29` Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness. `30` Stretch out your hand to heal and perform signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”
    `31` After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly.

## Quick takeaways

<aside>
💡 Commitment demands a response, it is an action

</aside>

# God's intent: Living in the Church family

> scripture
> 
- Church community committed to one another
- Epistles of Paul & Timothy: addresses the issues to a whole community
    - Everyone had a role to play in responding/ sending the letters to Paul

The church is still pretty imperfect

- Yet Paul still encourages these churches to live out their identity as a community

<aside>
💡 What does it mean for us, you and me today to live in a church family then?

</aside>

1. More than attendance, it's an investment
    1. Commitment to the work the Lord is doing through and in the church 
        
        > **`24`** And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, **`25`** not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching.
        > 
        
        Hebrews 10:24-25
        
    
    b. More than surface, it’s about going deeper
    
    1. we seek to know others and be known by others
    2. "Being a private person" → how far is too far?
        
        James 5:19
        
        > `19` My brothers and sisters, if one of you should wander from the truth and someone should bring that person back, `20` remember this: Whoever turns a sinner from the error of their way will save them from death and cover over a multitude of sins.

# God's intent: Loving the Church as how He does

John 13:34-35

> `34` “A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. `35` By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.”
> 

Love is best learnt when we committedly choose to love another not just comfortably but intentionally, sacrificially and perseveringly

"We like people who are like us but we love people whether they are like us or not" - PJ

When we love our brothers and sisters in Christ, we pledge our allegiance to them by covenanting with them in local-church life

1 Peter 2:12

> (NIV)
12 Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us.
(ESV)
`12` Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable, so that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation.

💡 A lone ranger doesn't make the best witness for God

</aside>

→ example: Smooaroute!!

<aside>
💡 Someone who is grounded has a home and is part of a solid covenant community of support is best prepared to draw others into the Kingdom of God

</aside>

"I probably ought to go to church tonight because there might be somebody there who would need me. There might be somebody there I could pary for. There might be somebody there I could sit with and sing hymns, praise to God. I better go tonight because it might encourage the pastor that I'm there. I better go because the Spirit of God might have something to say to me that's going to make my life more effective as a witness to the people around me. I really need to be there because there are going to be people there who probably have burdens and maybe I'll run into one of them and they will share it with me and I'll need to know it so I can pray about it." → Crystal modified quote

## Reflect

1. Why are you in Hope?

# Raphael's sharing

History of Baptisms

- Conversions not quite on the basis of faith → Conversion by the sword under post-Constantine
    - Does this translate to second generation christian? Raphael's encounter with David Sean
    - The second gen needs to be able to think about what the faith is for themselves
- Early church christians who live second-hand
    - Not having that eye witness encounter of the ministry of Jesus
    - Leading to the merger of Water and Spirit baptism as a single event
    - Began doing so to infants → infant baptism?
        - Mistakens the distinction between the two, until the Pentacostal movement came around

There was a divergence in the understanding of the significance of both rituals

## Water baptism: Key understanding

- Virtually universally practiced
    - Matthew 28:19
- Differeing perspectives on how and why
- Tied to our understanding of salvation

So why do it?

- To "receive grace"
- To "receive benefits"
- To "symbolise who we are"
    
    → Some, especially those in the older generation, attribute great significance to the permanence of baptism
    
    → "Entering the club"→ also enjoying the benefits of the in group
    
    → Process of initiation
    

Baptism as marriage

- how to liken the wedding ring to baptism to each understanding of what it is for
- The ring isn't necessary, but because of the wedding, one wears the ring
    - slightly different but important difference: doing it as a reflection
    
    1 Cor 12:12-13
    
    > `12` For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. `13` For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and all were made to drink of one Spirit.
    > 

But what do I gain from water baptism?

- Can I not just know that I am a believer
- if I don't do it, I'm not any different from other believers anyway?

It is a testimony — For who?

- 1 Peter 3:21
    
    > `21` Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a **good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,** `22` who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him.
    > 

Repentance and Faith

- Baptism as a sign
    - Intrinsically it has no meaning, but its value is inherited from what it points at
    - Baptism as a sign for repentance and faith
        
        → 3 questions on Baptism: Is Jesus who He says He is, If one has come to faith and received Jesus, if there is intention to live life in Christ till the End
        

## Spirit baptism

Mathew 3:11 (quoting John the Baptist)

> `11` “I baptize you with water for repentance. But after me comes one who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
> 

Mathew 3:11 (quoting John the Baptist)

> `11` “I baptize you with water for repentance. But after me comes one who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
> 

Acts 1:4-8

> `4` On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: “Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about. `5` For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.”
`6` Then they gathered around him and asked him, “Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?”
`7` He said to them: “It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority. `8` But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”
> 
1. Empowered to be witnesses
2. Empowered to serve the body
3. Empowered to ???

Acts 4:29-31

> `29` Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness. `30` Stretch out your hand to heal and perform signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”
`31` After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly.
> 

The Spirit enables the flesh to do what the flesh cannot do 

We only need the Spirit to live out God's plans in our lives

→ Jesus asked them to wait for the restoration of the Kingdom. That yielding and submission to the Spirit is the heart of the question Jesus poses before he Ascends
