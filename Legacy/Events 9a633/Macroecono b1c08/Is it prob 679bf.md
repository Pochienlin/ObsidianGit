# Is it problematic that the growth rate of real GDP depends on the base year chosen? If yes, how do we solve that?

Yes:

- It is always preferable to have a method which gives consistent results.
- the problem gets worse as the time horizon increases.

There is a solution though, the chain-weighted method, which computes a geometric average of the two possible growth rate:

We can then compute real GDP for the two possible base years:
