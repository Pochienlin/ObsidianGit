- Q1
    
    Assume an economy with two manufacturers: a parts and compontent manufacturer and a tablet manufacturer. Suppose that parts and components manufacturing does not require any intermediate inputs. In a given year, the parts and components manufacturer produces 50,000 units of parts and components, of which 45,000 units were sold to the tablet manufacturer at $100 per unit and the remaining units were stored as inventory. In the same year, the tablet manufacturer produces 25,000 tablets and sells all of them to consumers at $800 per unit. Compute GDP of this economy for the year using the product and expenditure approaches. Do the two approaches yield the same GDP?
    
    ### Product approach (aka va approach)
    
    components va = 50,000*100=5,000,000
    
    manu va - 25,000*800 - 45,000*100 = 15,500,000
    
    $GDP = 20,500,000$
    
    ### Expenditure approach
    
    Consumer expenditure = 25,000*800 = 20,000,000
    
    Inventory expenditure = 5,000*100 = 500,000
    
    $GDP = 20,500,000$
    
- Q2
    
    Assume an economy with a car manufacturer, a car seller, and some consumers (there is no government). The consumers are workers who earn a wage to finance their consumption. In a given year, the car manufacturer produces 50,000 cars and sells them for $10,000 per car. The workers’ wages take up 70% of the car manufacturer’s revenue. All the materials used for producing cars are imported from other countries at a cost of $1,000 per car. Half of the manufactured cars are exported overseas and the remaining cars are sold to the domestic car seller. The car seller sells the domestic cars and imported cars at the same price of $14,000 per car. The car seller sells all of the domestic cars and 5,000 of the imported cars to domestic consumers. After paying $6,000 for the cost of an imported car, the remaining sales revenue is equally distributed between wages and profits.
    
    1. a)  Calculate GDP using (i) the product approach, (ii) the expenditure approach, and
    (iii) the income approach.
    
    ### Product (value added)
    
    **Manufacturer:** Revenue - cost = 50,000*10,000 - 1,000*50,000 = 450,000,000
    
    **Seller:** Revenue - cost = 30,000*14,000 - 25,000*10,000 - 5,000 * 6,000 = 420,000,000 - 250,000,000 - 30,000,000 = 140,000,000
    
    **Total VA =** 590,000,000
    
    ### Expenditure
    
    Consumption = 14,000*30,000 = 420,000,000
    
    Export = 25,000*(10,000) = 250,000,000
    
    Import = 50,000*1,000 + 5,000*6,000 =80,000,000
    
    since I - 0, G=0: GDP = 590,000,000
    
    ### Income
    
    Wages_{manu} = 0.7*50,000*10,000 = 350,000,000
    
    Capital_{seller} = 30,000*14,000 - 25,000*10,000 - 5,000*6,000 = 420,000,000 - 250,000,000 - 30,000,000 = 140,000,000
    
    Capital_{manu} =  0.3*25,000*10,000 = 75,000,000
    
    Total = 565,000,000
    
    2. (b)  Calculate the current account balance. Does the economy have a current account surplus or deficit?
    
    3. (c)  Suppose that the car manufacturer is a foreign entity and all of its proits belong to foreigners. What would GNP and GDP in this economy be in this case?
