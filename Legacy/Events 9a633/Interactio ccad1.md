# Overview

**Empathy** teaches the things you didn‚Äôt know you didn‚Äôt know.

- Ethnographic methods involve ‚Äúdeep hanging out‚Äù
- Reveal users‚Äô tacit knowledge, such as
    - Undocumented practices (not defined in process)
    - Workarounds & hacks
- Challenges in interpreting observations

**Interviewing**

- Important principles (open-ended, unbiased questions etc.)
- Staging an actual interview

**Alternative strategies**

- Contextual Inquiry
- Capturing lead user‚Äôs feedback
- Diary and journal studies

## Main Concepts

The Design Thinking Process

- Empathy
- Define
- Ideate
- Prototype
- Test

# Lesson focus: Empathy

- Introductory case study: truck driver's console
    
    Observation is invaluable when designing information systems. Here‚Äôs a simple example.
    
    Qualcomm makes devices for truckers to log their hours and to get new orders remotely. They saw that there were a lot of data entry errors, and people in-house tended to blame the truckers for being uneducated. 
    
    One of the senior UI designers decided to do some fieldwork and spent a week at a truck stop observing truckers and interviewing them about their use of the Qualcomm device (which is very common in the logistics industry). 
    
    They discovered that the errors didn't come because the truckers were undereducated, but because the device had tiny buttons that they would have to punch, often while wearing gloves (because it's cold). Moreover, truckers tend to be big men, who have big fingers.
    
    The team redesigned the UI so that it was mostly Q&A with reasonable defaults for everything, and it had a big OK button that was easy to hit even if you were wearing mittens.
    
    Data entry error rates dropped dramatically.
    
    **TL;DR:**
    
    - Mostly Q&A
    - Fewer, bigger buttons
    - Data entry error rates dropped dramatically
- Case study 2: your eye will bleed

    <aside>
    üí° Human centric design requires observation, which demands empathy
    
    </aside>
    
    As a human-centered designer you need to understand the people for whom you are designing. The problems you are trying to solve are rarely your own‚Äîthey are those of particular users; in
    order to design for your users, you must build empathy for who they are and what is important to
    them.
    
    Watching what people do and how they interact with their environment gives you clues
    about what they think and feel. It helps you to learn about what they need. By watching people you
    can capture physical manifestations of their experiences, what they do and say.
    This will allow you to interpret intangible meaning of those experiences in order to uncover insights. These insights will lead you to the innovative solutions. The best solutions come out of the best insights into human behavior. 
    
    But learning to recognize¬†those insights is harder than you might think. Why? Because our minds automatically filter out a lot of information in ways we aren‚Äôt even aware of. We need to learn to see things ‚Äúwith a fresh set of eyes‚Äù ‚Äìtools for empathy, along with a human-centered mindset, is what gives us those new eyes.
    

Empathy is the foundation of a human-centered design process. To empathize, you:

- **Observe**. View users and their behavior in the context of their lives.
    
    **Observation**
    
    - Expression
    - Motivation
    1. What do people do now?
    2. What values and goals do people have?
    3. How are these activities embedded in a larger ecology?
- **Engage**. Interact with and interview users through both scheduled and short ‚Äòintercept‚Äô encounters.
    
    Engage to:
    
    - Uncover needs that people have which they may or may not be aware of
    - Guide innovation efforts
    - Identify the right users to design for
    - Discover the emotions that guide behaviors
- **Immerse**. Experience what your user experiences.
    
    In addition to speaking with and observing your users, you need to have **personal experience in the design space** yourself. Find (or create if necessary) experiences to **immerse yourself to better understand the situation** that your users are in, and for which you are designing.
    
    Engaging with people directly reveals a tremendous amount about the way they think and
    the values they hold. Sometimes these thoughts and values are not obvious to the people who hold
    them. A deep engagement can surprise both the designer and the designee by the unanticipated insights that are revealed. The stories that people tell and the things that people say they do‚Äîeven if they are different from what they actually do‚Äîare strong indicators of their deeply held beliefs about the way the world is.
    
    Good designs are built on a solid understanding of these kinds of beliefs and values.
    
- Outcome: Inspire new thinking by discovering what people really need

## Challenges in Observation

**Tacit Knowledge**

- Knowledge¬†that results from internalized information and experiences and is difficult to explicate in a formal way
- Knowledge and skills not documented
- Experience

**Examples**

- Agile methodology -

## Empathy ‚Äì Approach

Learning from the **Process**

- Well known rules or defined workflow
- Easy to discover (usually documented)

Learning from the **Practice**

- How people handle situations when rules fail (workarounds and hacks)
- Experts knowing when to break the rules
- Hard to discover, but equally important!

## Empathy ‚Äî Capturing Errors in Observations

- **Slips** are something that prevents completion
    - Make small physical design improvements
    - Correct intent, wrong action

[Preventing User Errors: Avoiding Unconscious Slips](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/slips/)

- Mistakes are **errors** user cannot correct

- Provide more information or design mental model that is easier
- Wrong intent

## Finding subjects

### Challenges

- to find willing candidates
- Environment may not always be conducive
- Candidate may not be ready or authentic
- Nature of product design
- Interviewer‚Äôs readiness

## Registering Observations

**Video**

- Rich data
- But reviewing/transcribing can take a long time

**Audio**

- Smaller files, less intrusive
- But same reviewing/transcribing problems as video

**Text**

- Logs, diaries, journals
- Other tips
    
    Set goals: If you go into an interview or observation session without goals, you‚Äôll
    feel lost.
    
    But you‚Äôll never use all the questions you wrote in the order you wrote them down.
    
    When documenting field work, a notebook and a still camera are invaluable.
    
    Writedown everything that seems half-way interesting in your notebook.
    
    Take pictures that capture critical ideas or actions.
    
    Recording video gets rich data, but it takes a long time to process it.
    
    Transcribing an entire recording is usually more trouble than its worth.
    
    Better to write down the time of interesting events or quotes, so you can transcribe those parts only.
    
    Recording audio is easier than recording video, and it often gets you everything you need (good quotes).
    

## Why interviews

**Objective**: to learn about users‚Äô **perception of your design**, not about its usability

- Provide a preview of your design, observe user perception of design by verbal response

**Implementation** 

- Location
    - Convenience and comfortable, to avoid user cancellation
    - Interviewer convenience, research team can observe
    - Beware of bias - is the location likely to sway user stories?
- Setting up the context & provide examples
    - Refer to the UI
    - This can nudge memory

[User Interviews: How, When, and Why to Conduct Them](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-interviews/)

## Principles

[Copy of Class Activity](Interactio%20ccad1/Copy%20of%20Cl%20991f0.md)

1. Ask open-ended questions
2. Avoid yes/no questions
3. Avoid biased (leading or directed) questions
4. Embrace silence
5. Be neutral
6. Building the rapport

## Interview Techniques

**Avoid directed questions**

**Example**: ‚ÄúDo you like the UI?‚Äù

- Hard to say ‚Äúno‚Äù to the designer

**Example**: ‚ÄúHow angry do you usually feel when an online transaction fails to go through successfully?‚Äù

- Leading question: What about other emotions?
- Better: ‚ÄúRecall a time when an online transaction failed to go through successfully. How did you feel?‚Äù
- Best: ‚ÄúRecall a time when an online transaction failed to go through successfully. What did you think or feel?‚Äù

### Planning Interviews

[Class Activity](Interactio%20ccad1/Class%20Acti%209da2e.md)

- Set clear objectives and goals
- Prepare the questions and the order you will ask
- Get background of users and set up context properly
- Anticipate responses by rehearsing
- Construct follow-up questions
- Learn from previous mistakes, rinse-and-repeat

## Lead Users
