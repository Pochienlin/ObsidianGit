# Aristotle's life

- Student of Plato, critic of Platonic philosophy
- Founder of *Lyceum*, tutor to Alexander the Great
- Influence on Western political thought
- Empiricism, naturalistic ethics, natural hierarchy, republicanism
    
    Aristotle vs. Plato
    
    - Platonic essentialism centers around "realms" ‚Äî The ideal realm exists beyond the object
    - Aristotle's essentialism exists intrinsically within the object observed (check if it is still considered essentialism)
        
        Essentialism in its purpose ‚Üí is this deontology?
        
        > And Aristotle grasps the essence of a thing, not as an abstract form, as Plato did. But as purpose or telos. ‚Üí Ulas
        > 
        - Dynamic, temporal conception
    
    "Nature makes nothing in vain" ‚Üí Aristotle 
    
    - Inherent purpose = teleology
        
        > all things derive their essential character from their function and their capacity ‚Üí aristotle
        > 
        - not in essence, timeless, abstract forms,
        - but potentials and purposes of capacities that define what things are, what, what the essence is, and their reason for existence

# Natural philosophy and ethics

- Unity of politics, science, and ethics: justice, truth, beauty
- Natural teleology: ‚Äùnature makes nothing in vain‚Äù
- Empiricism: ‚Äúobservation shows us ‚Ä¶‚Äù
- The good: consummation of purpose/end (*telos*)
- Natural hierachy betwen higher and lower things
    
    ### Determining Telos
    
    purpose of things can be grasped by observing that process of growth and development.
    
    ### Natural Hierarchy
    
    "whether it be a man, a horse, or a family, again, the end or final cause is the best"
    
    - consummation of a movement towards the fulfillment of a potential
        - E.g. plants exist for the benefit of animals, that's the telos, and some animals exist for the benefit of others.
        - if nature makes nothing purposeless or in vain, all animals must have been made by nature for the sake of men.
            - a purposeful hierarchy where the lower with supposedly lower order things exist for the sake of higher order things
                - inanimate ‚Üí animate ‚Üí humans
                - as something reproduce, it strives for more complexity and a higher order

# Polis and politics

- *Logos*: reason and language, unique human faculties
- ‚ÄúMan is by nature an animal intended to live in a polis‚Äù
    - Hierarchy of associations: self-sufficiency
        
        ### Telos of human beings
        
        Language as human's specific capacity
        
        > man alone of the animals is furnished with the faculty of language. Language serves to declare what is advantageous and what is the reverse and therefore, serves to declare what is just an unjust, it is the peculiarity of man in comparison with the rest of the animal world, he alone possesses that perception of good and evil of the just and unjust and other similar qualities.
        > 
        
        ‚Üí made for association. 
        
        <aside>
        üí° The Human Telos, according to Aristotle, is to live and associations to lead a social or social life. 
        But Aristotle continues, not just any association, but political Association. Man is a Political Animal.
        
        </aside>
        
    - Polis: ‚Äùwhile it grows for the sake of mere life, it exists for the sake of a good life‚Äù
- Mere life and good life: realization of human nature
    - Humans live the self-conscious, collective life
        - reflection, deliberation, and disagreement over the conditions and rules of coexistence
        - the inescapability of conflict and cooperation and disagreement
            
            > he alone possesses a perception of the good or evil of the just and unjust and have similar qualities and it is Association in these things which makes a family and a polis.
            > 
    - that not all associations are equally good ‚Üí good in the naturalistic ethics sense
        
        <aside>
        üí° not all associations equally allow or enable human beings to realize their potential to the fullest
        
        </aside>
        
        Aristotle designates polis, in his own words, the most perfect Association.
        
        ### Three types of association
        
        1. household, polis and village
        2. common point: criterion of self sufficiency
            1. human beings are not self sufficient; cannot exist without cooperation
                1. If not associated, is either beast of god
    
    Associations serve the sheer imperative of survival and satisfaction of material needs ‚Üí "the mere life"
    
    ### The Telos of association
    
    political association is the end or consummation of the association
    
    <aside>
    üí° while the polis grows for the sake of mere life, it exists for the sake of a good life
    
    </aside>
    
    all associations move towards the polis and the polis has as its own purpose, the good life
    
    - polis is not simply an alliance for the mere life {peace; safety, of person; security of property; promotion, of commerce and wealth}
        - {mere life} is what we share with the animals
    - The {good life} is in turn what is unique for humans
        - Other unique things: language and reason (which the Greeks don't differentiate)
        
        $language\;\&\;reason\;\;\; \therefore public\;association$
        
        - faculty of language and reason, according to Aristotle, is best exercised, that is utilized to the fullest in the active participation in public affairs, and in engagement, in debate and deliberation with fellow citizens on the affairs of the polis, that is engaging in politics
        
        $public\;association \implies Telos_{association}=Life_{good}$
        
- Household (private) vs. polis (public); economy vs. politics
    - household relationships {slave/master ;  husband/wife are natural associations}
- Politics: participation in public affairs; deliberation and debate
    - These are not naturalistic but political
- Good/evil; right/wrong; justice/injustice
    - Compared to household, political associations center around debating of these distinctions
    
    the government of equals of one's peers ‚Üí Republicanism
    

# Citizenship and virtue

- Authentic human life = life of the citizen
    - Polis as prior to the household and village: because it furnishes the conditions under which human beings can become truly human

[Athenian government, 4th century BCE](Political%20%208517e/Athenian%20g%2013005.md)

- Citizenship: holding office, administering justice
    - Functional definition
- Political engagement as *duty* to *res publica ("republic")*
- Public affairs/interests over private affairs/interest
    - Citizens served in turn, there was no specialisation of public sector (I think specialisation came in via the Weberian civil service?)
- Citizen virtue and friendship
    - not someone who just attached to one's private affairs and obeys the law.
    - But the good citizen is one who is constantly preoccupied with and engaged in public affairs
    - "Political busy body"
    - Discharges duties with utmost diligence
    - Friendship |
    Not indifferent to other citizens: investing in each others to do the same
        - Investing in each other with genuine care

- Boundaries of citizenship: criterion of equality
- Who should/can become citizens?
    
    All have the potential in the telos, but there are natural inequalities
    

- Hierarchies and exclusions: age, gender, class, status, origin
    - Children, women, old people, slaves, barbarians are not included
    - stated as a fact of life
    - manual labours deemed excluded except in "extreme democracies" because of leisure and independence
- Leisure and independence ‚Äì e.g. ‚Äùmechanics‚Äù
    - Freedom from necessity, freedom from domination
        - = Freedom from impediments. Someone who has to work hard labour does not have the mental capacity for the good life, but as much as the mere life
        - Furnish the necessities for the mere life, make good life possible but cannot drive it
- Property ownership and and slavery
    - Material basis of personal independence ‚Üí can exercise free judgement
    - Existence of slavery is helpful (necessary?) for the polis and is natural by telos

- Political rule vs. non-political rule

- Exercise of authority over equals
    - Pecularity compared to the master/slave husband/wife father/son versions of associations
- Dual capacity of citizen: ‚Äúboth how to rule and how to obey‚Äù
    - Rotation in office; selection (lot), election (vote)
        
        Analogy of running a boat
        
        - citizenship virtue that one weilds a power that others will one day rule over you
        - The rules can and will be ruled on the rulemaker eventually

- Critique of Plato‚Äôs elitism

- Wisdom of the many vs. wisdom of the few
    - Plato ‚Äî Ordinary citizen ruling: do they have the capacity?
    - When the citizen can reason as the few does by coming together
        - Each of them imperfect by themselves, but all when meeting together they are better or at least no worse
        - Each with something to contribute
        - Tapping into plurality that brings out the dynamism of the polis
- Judgment of the ruled vs. judgment of the ruler
    - A diner judges the feast
        - Best judge of ruling is by those who are ruled and not the ruler
        - Experience of being ruled helps evaluate what is a good rule
- Polis (plurality) vs. household (unity)

# Constitutions

- **[Axes]** Classification of constitutions:
    - Principle of rule (laws/people) and interests served (common/private)
    - Numbers (one/few/many) ‚Äì in fact, rich/poor
- 3 right constitutions and perversions
    - 3 right constitutions,
        - Royalty, aristocracy, constitutional government
    - 3 perversions
        - Tyranny, Oligarchy, Democracy
    - Numbers are accidental
        - Defining characters is the mental disposition that certain circumstances cultivates
        - Rule of the rich or the poor
- The best constitution: non-ideal; ‚Äúthe best way of life for the *majority* of states‚Äù
    - Jabs at Plato's idealism
- Polity: rule of the moderate property owners
    - Moderation: ‚Äúgoodness exists in a mean‚Äù
        - Allows them to take in the rule and the ruled perspectives
- Middle class (polity) vs. the rich (oligarchy) and the poor (democracy)
    - Highly unequal societies are not that of friends but of enemies
        - Factionalism and internal strife happens
            - Envy on one end and contempt on the other
        - Big middle class cultivates civility and equality of friendships among peers
- Equality, friendship, common interest ‚Üí stability

<aside>
üí° Justice to Aristotle is about treating equals equally, and unequals unequally

</aside>

![Untitled](Political%20%208517e/Untitled%202.png)

- Ordering of offices: numbers, powers, principles of appointment
    - Constitution is not the document but the institution's structures, rules and regulations etc
- Citizen body = body politic
    - There is no state-society distinction
    - Collective of citizens is the state

# Economics

- Natural vs. unnatural art of acquisition (*okionomia* vs. *chrematistike*)

- Acquisition as means vs. acquisition as end
- Natural art/ **"Provisioning"**: self-sufficiency; ‚Äùnecessaries‚Äù; natural limits
- Unnatural art: accumulation; ‚Äúsuperfluities‚Äù; unlimited

<aside>
‚ùì Is the limitation/ unlimitation a chip off the Platonic tripartite block? Or are they conceptually distinct?

What is the significance of delineating instruments of action/production? Is it simply to highlight the telos of currency is life and not and ends to itself?

</aside>

# Summary

- Philosophy: natural teleology; the good; morality and justice
- Politics: man, the political animal; logos; associations; polis
- Citizenship: political (in)equality; political rule; property and freedom; civic virtue
- Constitutions: common and private interests; social classes
- Property: natural and unnatural acquisition; purposeful economics

Breakout

- What is the major difference between Aristotle‚Äôs and Plato‚Äôs visions of the ideal political system?
- What are the different assumptions and arguments that lead each philosopher to these divergent conclusions?
- Which form of constitution does Aristotle deem preferable and why? What does a comparison with Plato‚Äôs ideal constitution reveal?

<aside>
üí° Plato's idea of the ideal polis would be, to Aristotle, a big household. There is no meeting of peers, deliberation, disagreement, bringing unique perspectives, unity in plurality. Instead there is a monolithic singularity ran by a patriarchy based upon what Plato believes to be a natural state of rule
