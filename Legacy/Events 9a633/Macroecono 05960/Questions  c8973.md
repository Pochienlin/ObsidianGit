## Q2.

gradient of utility given a fixed level of $U=\bar U$ will be $-a/b$ 

gradient of budget curve is given as $-w$

3 scenarios:

- where $a/b>w$, the utility curve is steeper than the budget curve. MRS > w, since leisure is too expensive $\forall \; 0≤h≤24;0≤l≤h$, the person opts for a corner solution of maximum consumption and 0 leisure

- where $a/b<w$, the utility curve is steeper than the budget curve. MRS < w, since consumption is too expensive $\forall \; 0≤h≤24;0≤l≤h$, the person opts for a corner solution of maximum leisure and 0 consumption

![Untitled](Questions%20%20c8973/Untitled%201.png)

- where $a/b=w$, the utility curve overlaps or is parallel to the budget curve. MRS = w, since leisure is perfectly substitutable for consumption $\forall \; 0≤h≤24;0≤l≤h$, any point along the budget line, as long as it is not less than the budget line (west or south of the line) will maximise utility

b. No, that is unlikely to be the case in real life. Human behavior is likely subject to diminishing marginal utility, which changes the MRS as it deviates from the center.

c. Yes, it is increasing in utility but not strictly so: the utility for bundle $(a, b)$ will have the same utility as $(a+1, b)$ or $(a, b+1)$, $(U = U')$ but more is still better because $(a+1, b+1)$ yields more utility as $(a, b)$. i.e. $(U≤U')$. Thus 

Regarding diminishing MRS, that is still true, just put to the extreme. An increase of 1 diminishes marginal utility of the factor to 0, which yields an $MRS' = 0 \;or \;-\infin$

## Q4

The wage is scaled by a factor of (1-t), i.e. the $MRS = -dC/dl = -w$ becomes $MRS = -dC/dl = -(1-t)w$

Red line is the taxed income with a tax rate of 0.7 (yikes!)

![Untitled](Questions%20%20c8973/Untitled%203.png)

Tax rate of 0.1. as we can observe, with increasing t, the red line pivots about l-intercept of (h,0) anti-clockwise

- When $t>0$, this results in the budget curve pivoting anti-clockwise along the l-intercept. i.e. the amount of consumption along the budget line is lowered at all points proportionally. The curve retains the straight line with constant gradient of $-(1-t)w$
- Intuitively, the tax increases the relative utility of labor, which is reflected as a lower MRS of consumption for leisure. The PPF shrinks as a result of the tax.
    - The income effect is negative, which results in less consumption and labour
    - The substitution effect increases the marginal product of labour, which increases the optimal amount of labour. This undos the income effect for labour
- If one where to draw a vertical line through the original budget line that intersects BL at (l*,C*), and the new budget line BL' at (l*,C'), one would find C*-C' as the tax revenue to the government
