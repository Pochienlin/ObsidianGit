# Practice: foreign domestic worker ban

It is inspired by question 9 on page 159 in Williamson: Assume, like Williamson does, that the government bans the household from hiring a foreign domestic worker. But, unlike Williamson, study the impact of this policy change assuming there is no change in preferences (and therefore the utility function). You must study the impact of this policy change on the budget constraint of the household and on its choice. Work on them before the next session when reviewing.
