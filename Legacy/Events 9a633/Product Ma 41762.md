# Research

## Market Research

**Market readiness**

Market readiness research is the process by which a company or organisation ensures that their product is ready to be launched in the marketplace. This process often involves interviewing potential users to see if the product solves a specific user need, or whether the product will help users become more efficient at task and researching the economics of sustaining the product.

The maturity of a industry allows businesses understand the possibilities of growth and thus exerts substantial influence on the product design.

## Market Maturity model

Market readiness may be considered in multiple dimensions

## Competitor research

A **competitive analysis framework** is a model you can use to help shape how you go about researching your competitors. It helps you home in on specific information by giving a structure to guide your market analysis.

Goals of conducting competitor research

- Awareness of external threats
- Awareness of internal gaps
- Resource planning
- Making decision on market entry
- Strategic planning how to enter
    - Where and what to focus
    - Value proposition

# Problem Statement Formation

## Importance

> “If there is no problem, there is no solution, and no reason for a company to exist.” – Vinod Khosla, Khosla Ventures
> 

What a clear and purposeful problem statement provides:

- Definition of the problem and goal
- Focus and alignment of the team towards the goal
- Understanding of the impact of solving the problem
- Reduce resource wastage

## Construct

From a design perspective, appropriate framing of a problem provides the following benefits -

- allows the problem to be solved in an actionable way
- helps to break down the global problem into smaller solvable pieces (see diagram below)
- aids agile learning and reduces investment risk

![Untitled](Product%20Ma%2041762/Untitled%204.png)

### Basic principles

- Avoid providing a solution
e.g. long queues in banks happened daily during peak hours are best solved using self-service kiosks
- Questions to ask (as quantifiable as possible)
    - Why this problem happened
    - Who is affected
    - What is the pain-point
    - What is the impact
    - Where did this issue happen

[Activity](Product%20Ma%2041762/Activity%209dd93.md)

- Example of unpacking a problem (at a call center) -
    
    (**Broad**) The assessment call is too complex, time consuming and administratively heavy, resulting in a diminished experience for the client as well as the staff member performing the work.
    
    (**Narrower**) This results in higher variability and length of call handling time, clients having to repeat their “story” as the move through the assessment and downstream case worker (meeting) process, clients providing more information than may be required, increased workload for the assessment worker and increased wait times in the (telephone) queue.
    
    (**Adds more resolution**) This is a daily operational occurrence but increases in call complexity related to changes in the knowledge base – multiple programs and changes in the environment (client demographics and needs/circumstances, legislation, etc.) – have resulted in an increase in severity and stress on the system.
    

**From the point of view of the user: “I am (persona) trying to (verb) but (barrier) because (cause) which makes me feel (emotional reaction).”**

e.g., “I am a new mum trying to take care of my baby in the best way possible, but I don’t know if I’m doing a good job because I’m always at home alone and don’t have anyone to talk to about it, which makes me feel isolated and alone.”

**Drawn from user research: “(Persona) needs a way to (user’s need) because (insight).”**

e.g., “New mums need a way to connect with other mums because they are often at home alone during the day and feel isolated and alone.”

**Using the 4 Ws: “Our (who) has the problem that (what) when (where). Our solution should deliver (why).”**

e.g., “Our new mum has the problem that she has no one to talk to about the best way to care for her baby when she is at home alone every day. Our solution should deliver a way for her to feel connected to other mums so she feels less isolated and alone.”

# Ideation

> “It’s not about coming up with the ‘right’ idea, it’s about generating the broadest range of possibilities.”
> 

Ideation is the process of generating possible solutions through methods such as sketching, prototyping, brainstorming individually or in a group setting.

Importance of team ideation

- Bring together perspectives and strengths of your team members
- Uncover unexpected areas of innovation and improve existing ideas
- Create volume and variety in your innovation options
- Create healthy working relationships

### Principles and how-to

1. Adapting to others’ perspectives: Be able to switch how you see, understand, and extend thinking as new input gets generated.
2. Disrupting: Be able to overturn commonly held beliefs, assumptions or norms in order to re-think conventional approaches.
3. Courage: Look upon dead-ends or challenges as opportunities and imagining the impact of overcoming them.
4. Be imaginative: Try to concept a new picture of reality, allowing the space required for inventing bridges to that reality.
5. Be experimental: Think of scrappy ways to test ideas and eager to venture into the unknown. Recognise Patterns and connecting dots: Synthesize common threads of meaning, and ways of
6. seeing, doing and behaving; utilize these commonalities to build solutions.
7. Curiosity: Be willing to ask uncomfortable, silly or even crazy questions. Be willing to explore and experience, in order to understand and learn something new and different.

# Information architecture

Information architecture (IA) is a science of organizing and structuring content so that users would easily adjust to the functionality of the product and could find what they need without hassle.

IA is a blueprint of the design structure which can be generated into wireframes and sitemaps of the project. UX designers use them as the basic materials so that they could plan navigation system.

Good information architecture is a foundation of efficient user experience, so the IA skill is essential for the designers. Effective IA makes the product easy to use but only united with design thinking the product has the powerful user experience.

### System components

- Organization systems
    - Hierarchical - uses different levels of abstraction for users to capture meaning as more is revealed
    - Sequential - shows a series of development to help users appreciate progression
    - Matrix - provides combinations or choices to users on content arrangement
        - Alphabetical schemes. Content is organized in alphabetical order. Also, they can serve as a navigation tool for the users.
        - Chronological schemes. This type organizes content by date.
        - Topic schemes. Content is organized according to the specific subject.
        - Audience schemes. The type of content organization for separate groups of users
- Labeling systems - highly abstracted information, e.g. broad categories
- Navigation systems - guided approach to help users find information
- Searching systems - provides single touch-point to access large information

# Prototyping

---

## Low fidelity Prototype

A low-fidelity prototype is an early draft of a design that excludes details and focuses on the key concepts to illustrate the functionality of the product. The goal is to turn ideas into testable artifacts that you can then use to collect and analyze feedback in the early stages.

Benefits of low-fi prototyping

- Simple, fast and cheap to produce - focus on design and concepts instead of making details of user interfaces.
- Real-time iteration - allows changes to made quickly based on user feedback.
- Accessible to everyone - allows even non-designers to participate in the design process and think through content, menus, and flow.

## High fidelity Prototype

High-fidelity prototypes offers interactivity to simulate how the product works but they are not fully functional. They are close to the final product, with most of the necessary design assets and components developed and integrated. Hi-fi prototypes are often used in the later stages to test usability and identify issues in the workflow.

Pinpoint specific components to test: You can dive deep into a single component (like flow, visuals, engagement, or navigation) during user testing. This allows you to get detailed feedback on certain elements of the design that would not be possible with pen and paper.

More presentable to stakeholders: Clients and team members will get a clear idea of how the product will look and work before it ever goes live. You can also set clear expectations with developers in the early stages on how much time will be needed to build your prototype and have a finished product.

# Product Design

---

## Quick checklist for product design

- [ ]  Who your product is designed for? (Persona)
- [ ]  Consider what is the job to be done? (Scenario)
- [ ]  Consider how complex is it (or how fast) to get the job done?
- [ ]  What are the current paradigms you can learn from?
- [ ]  Where are the gaps and opportunities you can seize?
- [ ]  What is the value-add you are providing?

## Cognitive walkthrough

A cognitive walkthrough is a structured approach to evaluating usability of a product. It involves the tester, who is not a user, asking four simple questions about the way a specific user journey is conducted.

1. Will user really want to do the action?
2. Will correct action be visible?
3. Will user recognize which action is correct?
4. Will user interpret feedback correctly?

## Heuristic

A heuristic is a mental shortcut that allows people to solve problems and make judgments quickly and efficiently.

Heuristic evaluation involves having a small set of evaluators examine the interface and judge its compliance with recognized usability principles (the "heuristics").

A quick, cheap, and easy UI evaluation method typically used by experts performing the following:

- Test UI guided by heuristics
- Record problems rank by severity

## Nelson’s 10 Heuristics

1. Visibility of system status
2. Match between real life and system
3. User control and freedom
4. Standards and consistency
5. Error prevention

1. Recognition over recall
2. Flexibility and efficiency of use
3. Aesthetics and minimalist design
4. Help user recognise, diagnose and recover from errors
5. Help and documentation

# Inclusive design

Definition: The design of mainstream products and/or services that are accessible to, and usable by, as many people as reasonably possible ... without the need for special adaptation or specialised design.

Inclusive design does not suggest that it is always possible (or appropriate) to design one product to address the needs of the entire population.

Instead, inclusive design guides an appropriate design response to diversity in the population through:

- Developing a family of products or derivatives to provide the best possible coverage of the population.
- Ensuring that each individual product has clear and distinct target users.
- Reducing the level of ability required to use each product, in order to improve the user experience for a broad range of customers, in a variety of situations.

# Adaptive through personalisation

- Personalisation creates new dimension in design by allowing certain elements in design to be dynamically adjusted
    - By role
    - By individual
- Key information structure and interaction model remains
- Customization gives control to user
- Personalization is performed by system based on information about user
- Using AI for personalization

# Ethical design

Ethical design is about designing great products alongside morals and beliefs and the principles of your business. Whatever is being created, whether a website, a marketing campaign or a product, has an effect on real people and environment.

Issues

- Extraction of personal information
- Tracking of usage behavior
- Behavioral engineering
- Promotion of racism, terrorism etc.
