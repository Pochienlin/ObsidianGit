# Product v. Project Manager

A **product** is a good that satisfies the needs of a particular group, also known as a target market. Each product goes through the product life-cycle, from development to market testing and, ultimately, release.

A **project**, on the other hand, is a collection of tasks to accomplish a specific goal. Projects should have outcomes and deliverables, which can be anything from a website revamp to a new internal process.

# History

How did product management come about?

- How would product management continue to evolve in the future?

- In 1931, Neil H. McElroy from Procter & Gamble wrote a famous memo as a justification to hire more employees (known as ‚ÄúBrand man‚Äù with focus on
    - Studying markets and keeping records if they meet expectations
    - Develop strategies to improve
    - Rally internal stakeholders to execute the plan
    - Experiment with product changes along marketing needs
- 1940s, Hewlett-Packard (HP) introduced a unique structure where each product group had to become a separate organization responsible for its development, manufacturing, and sales
- 1950s, Toyota focused on two essential principles: kaizen (PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, and Act) cycle) and genchi genbutsu (going back to the source to find the facts and make the right decisions. Genchi genbutsu translates into ‚Äúgo and see for yourself.‚Äù) and eventually invented the kanban system
- 60s-70s: many brands are established and the link between value proposition and brand especially FMCG had started to be more pronounced
- 80s-20xx: computers, software/SaaS and Internet revolutionized consumption and how ‚Äúproducts and services‚Äù are defined. Successful tech companies created their own product management culture and processes

# What is product lifecycle?

A product life cycle is the length of time from a product first being introduced to consumers until it is removed from the market. A product's life cycle is usually broken down into four stages; introduction, growth, maturity, and decline.

# Digital Transformation

What is **Digital Transformation**?

Digital transformation is the strategic adoption of digital technologies... to improve processes and productivity, deliver better customer and employee experiences, manage business risk, and control costs.

What is **NOT digital transformation**?

- Converting an off-line task into an online one
- Using more software
- Doing the same tasks except with software
- Hiring more people to write software when users are dwindling

### Why is digital transformation important?

- Better customer experience: Consumers today are inundated with choices. Businesses need to not only deliver innovative products or services but meaningful interactions and experiences that delight customers and foster brand loyalty. Digitally transformed organizations are in a better position to achieve this.
- Better employee experience: Research has shown that companies that invest in employee experience have a more engaged, productive workforce, which translates to a better customer experience. Digital transformation can help organizations become more efficient in operations so that employees enjoy better quality of life.
- Higher product agility: Digital transformation helps product become more responsive to user needs as they evolve.
- Higher productivity: Streamlined workflows, digital processes, and automated tasks are all ways organizations can create efficiencies. In an aggregated manner, economies become more productive and this leads to raised standard of living and per capita wealth.

# Common challenges

- **Lack of strategy:** Digital transformation is a continuous and evolving process. A short-shorted view and execution goal by implementing technology without looking at how it fits in the big picture can create more challenges than benefits. Strategies and ideas on digital transformation should stem from a vision while keeping business goals and objectives in mind and without creating an conflict between them.
- **Lack of leadership buy-in**: This can happen due to misalignment with business objectives. Leadership understanding and support is critical to the success of any transformational strategies especially when it pertains to resource commitment.
- **Planning in a silo:** Conventional thinking around digital transformation being an IT function is no longer valid. Often than not, digital transformation is a process and culture that needs to be nurtured and it involves all departments within the organization.
- **Lack of rigor in measuring success:** Digital transformation efforts typically dwindle when the impact is not well measured and successes are not celebrated. The end effect is the loss of interest in stakeholders and the eventual dissipation of investment that will kill the momentum completely.
