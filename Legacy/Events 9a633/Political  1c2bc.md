# Plato's life and context

- Plato was the founder of the Academy in Athens (basis of modern western education)
- committed anti Democrat: an inveterate defender of social and political hierarchy
    - staunch advocate of political rule by a wise elite
- Ancient Greek city-state (*Polis*) – ”politics”
    - Not the only form of organisation: Towns, villages, small communities
    - Polis remains the largest unit of political organisation
- Public spirit and political participation
    - Greek understanding of politics was capacious: everything pertaining to daily management of the polis of the city state
        - Broad conception of the public sphere
        - contrast with a trncated, narrow conception of the private sphere
            - Anywhere beyond your door is public sphere
            - No distinction between politics, civil societies, economy
        - Ancient Greeks were very politically minded
            - Spent most of their activities, time and energy organising in public activities, festivals and plays
            - Majority of material wealth devoted to public activities
                - Personal consumption was relatively modest, but public expenditure was lavish
                - Building of temples and emphitheatres, gather and deliberate
                - Appear in public life via artworks, sculpture
                    - Artworks were not for private but public beholding
- Athens, 5th century BCE: direct democracy, juries, courts, committees, assemblies
    - Largest, most prosperous of the city states.
    - At peak, 400,000 inhabitants
    - Giants of Greek philosophy: Socrates, Plato, Aristotle lived there
- Citizens, aliens, women, children, slaves
    - Athenian democracy was characterised by political participation, and most importantly, direct democracy.
    - Not as democratic as many today would assume
        - no elected representatives, professional politicians, all citizens,
        - political participation was a highly prized privilege. It was restricted only to citizens.
            - not only entitled to, but we're also expected to perform, jury duty in courts, participate in legislation at the Legislative Assembly, hold offices in various executive committees, and fulfil a host of other civic functions.
            - restricted the citizens who consists of males born to Athenian parents,
                - citizenship by default, excluded women, children, resident aliens, and slaves.
                - even at the apex of Athenian democracy out of a 400, population of 400,000, people, roughly 30,000, were qualified to be citizens
- Execution of Socrates
    - Plato was a student of Socrates
    - put to death by the Athenians for corrupting the youth and disrespecting the gods.
        - Socrates would go around and ask questions,
        - people randomly and pursue these questions to the point where people would start doubting what they thought they knew, and questions about virtue questions about politics, questions about the the existence of gods or the nature of gods and so on and so forth.
        - relentlessly pursue people down to the other paths of critical thinking
        - they judge then tried Socrates condemned him to death or exile
            - Socrates chose death over exile because he wanted to die by his own accord

# Morality and justice

- Plato’s ideal: the moral/just community
    - Morality: individual (wisdom), communal (justice)
        - For Plato, morality is both an individual and a communal value
        - individual: wisdom sort and moral individual
        - communal level: justice
        
        <aside>
        💡 moral community == just community to Plato

    - Tripartite human pysche: reason, passion, desire
        - Reason: intellect, contemplation, reflection, wisdom
        - Passion: courage, bravery, resolve
    - Morality: harmonious ordering of the parts
        - not just about rules or norms of right and wrong at a given specific place in a given specific situation.
        - foundational concept that ought to apply universally, and across all situations, across all phenomena
        - doesn't have a substance
            - formal term: harmonious order
    - Hierarchy: the rule of reason
        - Tripartite are not of equal value
            - when the part which is naturally better is in control of the worst part, then we use this phrase self mastery.
            - harmonious ordering between the parts is inescapably a hierarchical ordering
        - desires, appetites needs are endless. They don't have a form. They don't have a direction, that chaotic.
        - faculty of reason is what enables order is what enables measure and moderation.
        - faculty of reason is what enables order is what enables measure and moderation.

1. Tripartite social structure: producers (desire), auxiliaries (passion), rulers (reason)
2. Essentialism: innate dominance of one faculty
3. Morality of the community: harmonious ordering of the three classes
4. Hierarchy: rule of the wise minority over
the irrational/desirous majority

# Building a just community

- “Noble lie,” myth of the metals
- Hierarchy and status ascription by nature
- Educating guardians: communal living; community of women and children
- ”Moral egotism”; erasing private feelings

### Philosopher kings: the rule of wisdom

> “Unless communities have philosophers as kings … in other words, unless political power and philosophy coincide ... there can be no end to political troubles” (p. 193)
> 

# Philosophical idealism

1. Political judgement and its basis
- Key binary: essences vs. appearances
- Philosophical idealism: reality of ideas
- Cognition vs. sense experience || form vs. content
- Unity and universality vs. plurality and particularity
- Knowledge/truth vs. belief/opinion
- Capacity for knowledge = capacity for rule
- “Reference point” for laws, customs, institutions
- Knowledge vs. opinion of the good, moral, just
- Unity and certainty vs. disagreement and flux

### Allegory of the ship

### Allegory of the cave

# Masses, sophists, democracy

- Democracy: whims and opinions of the public
- Excessive freedom, unnatural equality
- World upside down; lawlessness, chaos
- Sophists, manipulation, and corruption into tyranny
