## What is this course about?
- **Broad-based** – covering digital strategy, challenges (esp., societal), limitation of technology
- Not in-depth technology courses – refer to other courses like AI, and cloud technology for the implementation
- Focus on **sharing cases, and applications** to give you another perspective!
- The project is NOT about proposing the latest and most shiny technology, but rather, **how feasible is for the company to do the transformation**. what is the most suitable technology enabler(s)?
> [!tip]
> This course does not offer a formula for digital transformation
> - Even within the same industry, meaningful factors may differ greatly
