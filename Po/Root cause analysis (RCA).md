Root cause analysis (RCA) is a systematic process for identifying “root causes” of problems or incidents and an approach for responding to them.

RCA is based on the basic idea that effective management requires more than merely “putting out fires” for problems that develop, but finding a way to **prevent them**.

- RCA helps pinpoint contributing factors to a problem.
- RCA creates Root Cause Impact (RCI) and Root Cause Recommendations (RCR) - recall static analysis in BPAS
