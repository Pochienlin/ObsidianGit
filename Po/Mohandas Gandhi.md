# Overview

Race and paradox of universalism

- Colonialism and modern racism
- Gandhi, British Empire, and non-violence
- **Contrasting:** Fanon, French Empire, and violence

# Race and the paradox of universalism

Race: delimiting the politically relevant universe (the community of equals)

- Racism: exclusion based on belief in the innate inferiority of a group
- Doctrines and attitudes; laws and policies; prejudices and practices
- Race as a social construct: arbitrary, circumstantial markers of difference

Racism as a system of power

- Material: distribution of resources and positions – class (e.g. racialized labor)
- Legal: formal rights or their exercise – citizenship (e.g. “second-class citizens”)
- Symbolic: self-worth, dignity – identity (e.g. “separate but equal” = unequal)

# Colonialism and Racism

Modern European colonialism (16th-20th century) and the birth of racism as a political language (18th-20th century)

- Construction of European “whiteness” and “non-whiteness”
- Hierarchical ordering of social difference: white, yellow, red, brown, black
- Military, political, economic dominance: race as a narrative of superiority

Racial binaries: reason/passion, virtue/effeminacy, industry/sloth, freedom/servility, progress/stagnation…

- Racism as imperial ideology: enslaving irrational blacks, expropriating savage Indians, dominating servile Asiatics
- Scientific racism: from monogenesis and differentiation to polygenesis and biological difference

Anti-colonialism and repudiation of racism

- Western civilization as barbarism: conquest, exploitation, corruption
- The colonized as the true bearers of universal ideals
- Claims to moral worth, dignity, equality, autonomy
- Violent and non-violent anti-colonialism: Fanon and Gandhi

# Gandhi, British Empire, and non-violence
> [!note]
> 💡 Satyagraha, or "holding firmly to truth", or "truth force", is a particular form of nonviolent resistance or civil resistance. Someone who practises satyagraha is a satyagrahi

#### Gandhi on self-rule (Swaraj):
- Religious toleration
- Non-violent resistance (Satyagraha)
- Self-sufficiency (Swadeshi)

#### Colonialism and racism inherently unjust: civilizational hierarchy; degradation and humiliation
- Countering injustice by violent and non-violent means
- Violent means counterproductive: death, pride, and future cycles of violence
- Alternative path: non-violence, soul-force

## [[Satyagraha]]: non-violent disobedience to unjust laws, suffering the consequences (vs. rebellion)
- Disobedience as non-cooperation; withdrawal of consent; dissolution of authority; naked power
- Contra legal positivism: higher laws; legitimacy / legality
- Antinomian challenge to the sovereignty principle

## [[Satyagraha]] as political strategy for self-rule
- Subjective conditions of satyagraha: faith, resolve, will, fearlessness
- The ultimate sacrifice: disobedience and martyrdom
- Effectiveness of non-violence: example of virtue, integrity, love
- Inciting shame and sympathy in the oppressors and spectators

## [[Satyagraha]] as a way of life: challenging instrumental rationality (means-ends) in politics (cf. [[Machiavelli]])
- Love, truth, wisdom: primal force of human bonds
- A new history: invisible acts of love, pity, kindness (vs. states, statesmen, power, wars)
- Cosmopolitan potential of satyagraha: from family to humanity
