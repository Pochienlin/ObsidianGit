The Kano Model describes the connection between customer satisfaction and the realization of customer requirements. Noriaki Kano, professor (emeritus) of Tokyo University of Science, developed a model for customer satisfacton in 1978, known today as the Kano Model. He determined 5 characteristics of customer requirements:

### **Threshold attributes (Must-be qualities)**.

- These attributes are taken for granted when fulfilled but result in dissatisfaction when not fulfilled.
    - Customers expect these attributes and view them as basic;
    - it is unlikely that they are going to tell the company about them when asked about quality attributes.

### **Performance attributes (One-dimensional qualities)**.

- These attributes result in satisfaction when fulfilled and dissatisfaction when not fulfilled.
    - These are attributes that are spoken and the ones in which companies compete.
    - If they are excelled customer satisfaction increases accordingly.

### **Excitement attributes (Attractive qualities)**.

- These attributes provide satisfaction when achieved but do not cause dissatisfaction when not fulfilled.
- They are not normally expected and thus often unspoken.

### **Indifferent qualities**.

- These aspects are neither good or bad and have no effect, positive or negative, on customer satisfaction.

### **Reverse qualities**.

- If theseÂ aspects exist they lead to dissatisfaction;
- if they do not exist they do not lead to satisfaction.

It is not possible to deduce an overall satisfaction level from the Kano Model.
