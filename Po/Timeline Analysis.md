**Timeline Analysis is an easy way to investigate an incident or problem:**
1. Get all data from multiple sources for everything that happened such as entries from system logs, emails, service desk records, and many other sources
2. Sort the data by date and time, regardless of where it came from.
3. List everything that happened in time order
4. Look for patterns

**Always start with timeline analysis to understand what happened and ensures all the information is available.**
