# What is Enterprise Solution Management?

## Enterprise

- a unit of economic organization or activity, especially a business venture or organization e.g. a large company

## Solution (IT)

- one or more systems used for a business process

## Enterprise Solution

Enterprise solutions are designed to integrate multiple facets of a companyâ€™s business through the interchange of information from various business process areas and related databases.

- These solutions enable companies to retrieve and disseminate mission-critical data throughout the organization, providing managers with real-time operating information satisfying the needs of an organization rather than individual users.
- They tend to be very knowledge-intensive and a significant investment, implemented on a large-scale basis, and require the attention of specialized IT technicians who understand how to implement them properly often with an incredible amount of risk associated.
- In comparison to consumers and small companies, an enterprise has greater requirements for availability, compatibility, reliability, scalability, performance and security, among other things.

## Management

- the process of dealing with or controlling things and people. Responsibility, leadership and ownership.

> ðŸ’¡ **The main point**
> Enterprise Solution Management is primarily supporting live IT systems and applications.

- Good development is important
- Good support is even more important
- For every 1 year of development thereâ€™s 5-10+ years of support required.

# The Big Picture
![Untitled](Enterprise%20d1a41/Untitled%204.png)

[**Activity 1: System Support**](Enterprise%20d1a41/Activity%201%20bfff3.md)

# Scope of support
## Relevance
- All businesses are becoming increasingly technical

## Certification
- Microsoft, ITIL, CMMI, AWS
- Infrastructure e.g. networks

## Team and roles
- Support team
- Virtual teams
- Can't do support alone

## Drivers
- Lose and gain money through:
    - Customer experience
    - Quality of products and services
    - Incident recovery

## Industries
- Finance, health, manufacturing, tech, arts, government

## Future
- Increasing need for support
- Dev is going to product vendors
- Premium paid for good support specialists

# Why should I care

## Caring, upside:

- Job for life
- Best way to be a CTO
- Learn a lot, the hard way
- Become resilient
- Become a better developer, IT manager or user

## Donâ€™t care, downside:
- Lose sleep (and hair)
- Get stressed (a lot)
- Confusion
- Keep getting the same problems occurring
- Lose customers
- Enterprise solution example
    
    An example of a generic enterprise solution used in a sales setting would include functions and abilities such as:
    
    - Salespeople log client information, including personal and product information and location.
    - Customer service representatives track client issues and communication alongside internal responses and updates.
    - Internal-facing employees take client specifications to build a product.
    - Managers and C-level executives track client and employee performance.

# Typical IT Department Structure

![Untitled](Enterprise%20d1a41/Untitled%205.png)

Support is typically not:

- Infrastructure - e.g. networks, servers, telcos
- Developers
- Project managers
- Business analysts

- Typical example of how ESM functions are organised along system ownership.
- Red boxes are support functions.
- Orange boxes are used in the project role play.

# Who does ESM?

- Responsibilities

# Capabilities and Maturity

[Activity: A CTO View](Enterprise%20d1a41/Activity%20A%20a5328.md)

**Capability Maturity Model (CMM)**

- Best practices for IT solutions

**DevOps**

- Automated design, build, deploy and maintain

# Future of Support
- More demand for technology means more demand for ESM
- Automation increases and becomes more complex e.g. A.I.
- Data analytics is becoming more common
- Faster responses are expected from customers
- Lower costs is a key business need to compete
- The balance between humans and bots will continue to change
