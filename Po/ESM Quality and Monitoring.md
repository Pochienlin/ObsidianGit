# [[Six Sigma]] framework and the [[Kano Model]] Analysis
| Dissatisfiers  | Satisfiers | Delighters  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Expected features of a product or service | Standard features that increase or decrease satisfaction by their degree (cost/price, ease of use, speed) | Unexpected features or characteristics that impress customers and earn the company ‚Äúextra credit.‚Äù |
| (Must be‚Äôs, unspoken) | (One-dimensional, spoken) | (excited by, unspoken) |
| E.g. System crashes, confusion in use | E.g. Functionalities of the app | Easy to use, connects to other applications |
In Six Sigma quality is defined using the Kano analysis:
- #### Dissatisfiers (Must be‚Äôs, unspoken)
    - Expected features of a product or service
- #### Satisfiers (One-dimensional, spoken)
    - Standard features that increase or decrease satisfaction by their degree (cost/price, ease of use, speed)
- #### Delighters (excited by, unspoken)
    - Unexpected features or characteristics that impress customers and earn the company ‚Äúextra credit.‚Äù

# What Drives Good Quality?
The main drivers of quality are:
- #### People
    - Everyone is responsible and accountable
    - Try to ‚ÄúDo it right the first time‚Äù
- #### Systems
    - Low defects rates
    - Resilient
    - Good performance
- #### Process
    - Efficient - throughput
    - Effective - low rework
    - Lean - minimum steps
- #### Measurements
    - Performance for business and technology - CTQs and KPIs
    - Test results
    - Monitoring

## Measurements
Quality needs to be measured.

The performance indicator for High level measurable objectives is called ‚ÄúCritical to Quality‚Äù (CTQs)

In Six Sigma quality problems are also called defects, defined as anything outside a requirement e.g.:

- Lost letters - count
- An incorrect surgical operation - count
- No signal on a mobile phone - number of minutes per week
- A business process that takes longer than acceptable - count how often
