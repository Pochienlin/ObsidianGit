## Objective vs. Subjective Human Rights
- objective: accepted regardless of belief race gender etc. eg. Right to life, freedom from slavery and torture
- subjective: eg. Right to vote, marry, religionÂ 

Civil and political rights
Economic social and cultural rightsÂ   

**Individualism and human rights**Â 
- while one does not strictly imply the other, some human rights are implied by individualism. \
	- Individualism argues the individual ought to be the focus of moral political and social concerns and should be free from social control. 
	- This necessitates freedom of expression and beliefs. But believing in this does not equate to believing all humans ought to have the same set of rights.

American and French revolution as a precursor to human rights
Asian philosophy focuses on community â€”> less focus on the rights of individuals


**Human rights regimes**
- intional, regional, nationalÂ 
- effective international regime in promoting but not effective implementing it
- EU as a human rights regime
- human rights as a tool of major power

**Human rights in the global south**
- dev countries must give dev priority Â» human rights
- starving people cannot benefit from HR
- "Human rights begins at breakfast"

## Barriers
1. Cost of HR
2. Ethnic divisions
3. Corruption
4. Traditions

## Developing without HR: 
eg. asian tigers (exception) $\implies$ successful economic development under authoritarian rule
- Human rights are not necessary for development IF developmental metrics are not concerned with quality of life
- Human rights and development can be mutually reinforcing: freedom of speech and right to fair trail, 
	- e.g. can result in more stability which fosters better econ dev, which in turn gives more resources to support freedom of leisure, education, access to needs etc
- They can also be at odds against each other: maximizing economic dev may at times strip others of freedom of expression (Tiananmen)  

## Cultural imperialism
- HR as a western concept and claims to universalism
- culture can sometimes be at odds with human rights: e.g. Islam and women's rights, nationalism and human rights

## Capitalism v HR
- premised on tenants of HR, but violates HR everywhere: worker exploitation

## HIV
- 95% infected in developing world
- 22 mil in subsaharan africa with HIV
