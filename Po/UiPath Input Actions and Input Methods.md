##  Input methods
To replicate actions, Studio supports 3 input methods for performing input actions:
1. Default
	1. Captures the input given while interacting with the UI element of the screen
2. Send Windows Messages
	1. Captures actions performed using keyboard and mouse
3. Simulate type/click
	1. Much faster than the other 2
	2. Does not capture input given by the keyboard
