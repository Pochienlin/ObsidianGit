## Types of automation
DS Harder an engineer working for Ford Motors coined the term Automation. Automation describes the increased use of automatic devices and controls and mechanized production lines. The best automation instance is in the manufacturing process. Which was dependent on human labor earlier but is now fully automated. As per the definition, automation is the technology by which you execute a process or procedure with minimal human assistance. It improves any process mechanism by removing unwanted or repetitive tasks to enhance the overall performance. A simple example of automation is automated bottle filling stations.

> Automation frees manpower up for other tasks. This is useful when the [[marginal product]] of capital exceeds the marginal product of labour

### Physical automation
If you hear the words Automation and Robotics, it's likely that they're referring to physical automation. The use of physical robots and specific control systems to automate physical processes is known as physical automation. A vehicle plant with a high level of autonomy is an excellent example of this. When people discuss automation in general, however, they are usually talking
about software automation.

> Bottle filling stations and robotic arms are examples of physical automation

### Software automation
Software automation is the use of a software to automate processes that people undertake on computers. UiPath is the global leader in automation. Now, as you have understood the term automation, take a pause and think of examples of automation around you that make your work easier by taking on repetitive and time consuming tasks. The next item in this lesson is a reading material that explains the history of automation. As you read it, you will gain insights into the evolution of automation.

## Automation
The term automation was coined by DS Harder, an engineer working for Ford Motors. The term described the increased use of automatic devices and controls in mechanized production lines.¬†However, the history of automation began more than 2300 years ago. With technological advancements, the development of this technology became increasingly dependent on computers and computer-related technologies.

-   Around 300 B.C., the first attempts at automation are linked to the idea of measuring time. Mechanical clocks began to appear in Europe towards the end of the 13th century. The Greeks, the Arabs, and the Egyptians attempted to automate water clocks (or clepsydras, used from the 16th century B.C.). These were followed by introducing automation into windmills, steam engines, etc.
    
-   With the industrial revolution in the 1800s came many advancements like the introduction of the telegraph, telephone and the concept of programmable machines. The 19th century witnessed the electrification of many factories, creating the need for centralized control. The first attempts were simple on/off mechanisms. In 1937, the first electronic digital computer was designed, followed by personal computers and the Internet in 1974.
    
-   Further, in the 20th century, improvements in data-storage technology, software to write computer programs, advances in sensor technology, etc., contributed to the progress in automation technology. With the introduction to ‚ÄúRobotic Process Automation‚Äù in the 21st century, the concept of software robots developed.
    
-   In recent times, RPA has grown by integrating the latest I.T. technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Software Robots are already able to automate simple and repetitive processes. By combining RPA with machine learning and AI, the performance of the robots can further be improved, enabling them to make complex decisions with the use of programming.
