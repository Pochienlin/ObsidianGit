## Case study on environmental impacts of international trade
Suriname provides a textbook trade-off between global economic trade and natural resource protection. As an economy that focus on mineral, oil and crops export, Suriname's economy barely improved since its founding in 1975. 

Suriname is covered in forests and this was vital to the country's climate and carbon goals. It is also a developing country with a relatively high level of human development

### Climate and Biodiversity
Due to the variety of habitats and temperatures, biodiversity in Suriname is considered high. In October 2013, 16 international scientists researching the ecosystems during a three-week expedition in Suriname's Upper Palumeu River Watershed catalogued 1,378 species and found 60‚Äîincluding six frogs, one snake, and 11 fish‚Äîthat may be previously unknown species. According to the environmental non-profit Conservation International, which funded the expedition, Suriname's ample supply of fresh water is vital to the biodiversity and healthy ecosystems of the region.

Snakewood (Brosimum guianense), a tree, is native to this tropical region of the Americas. Customs in Suriname report that snakewood is often illegally exported to French Guiana, thought to be for the crafts industry.

On 21 March 2013, Suriname's REDD+ Readiness Preparation Proposal (R-PP 2013) was approved by the member countries of the Participants Committee of the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF).

As in other parts of Central and South America, indigenous communities have increased their activism to protect their lands and preserve habitat. In March 2015, the "Trio and Wayana communities presented a declaration of cooperation to the National Assembly of Suriname that announces an indigenous conservation corridor spanning 72,000 square kilometers (27,799 square miles) of southern Suriname. The declaration, led by these indigenous communities and with the support of Conservation International (CI) and World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Guianas, comprises almost half of the total area of Suriname." This area includes large forests and is considered "essential for the country's climate resilience, freshwater security, and green development strategy.

The Central Suriname Nature Reserve has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its unspoiled forests and biodiversity. There are many national parks in the country including Galibi National Reserve along the coast; Brownsberg Nature Park and Eilerts de Haan Nature Park in central Suriname; and the Sipaliwani Nature Reserve on the Brazilian border. In all, 16% of the country's land area is national parks and lakes, according to the UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre.

### Economic diversification
Since a turbulent period in the 1980s after a coup and several electrion frauds, the country has diversified away from Bauxite trade, which has lead most of the economy under the Dutch East Indies Company. In 2016, Bauxite still accounts for 15% of GDP and 70% export earnings.

More than 93% of Suriname's landmass consists of unspoiled rain forest. The country has since developed into sectors such as 
1. Ecotourism (new!)
2. Oil (new!)
3. Banana
4. Shrimp
5. Rice
6. Gold
7. Hydroelectric power

Due to its poor timing, there was an oil crisis when Suriname started exploiting their oil sources, and commodity trade has ben unstable since, resulting in poor capitalization of natural resources. Despite its attempts to branch into ecotourism, the new sector has taken a hit since the advent of COVID-19 lockdowns on travel. Due to COVID-19, their GDP is 80% that of pre-pandemic trends. 

That said, their GDP by PPP has exhibited promising growth trends disregarding externalities. The diversification, while slow to yield results, has helped the country manage risks better over time.

## Political geography
Suriname (/Ààsj ä…ôr…™n√¶m, -n…ëÀêm/ (listen); Sranan Tongo: Sranankondre or Sranan [s…æa.na≈ã]), officially the Republic of Suriname (Dutch: Republiek Suriname [reÀêpyÀåblik ÀåsyÀêriÀànaÀêm…ô], Sranan Tongo: Ripolik fu Sranan), is a country on the northeastern Atlantic coast of South America. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north, French Guiana to the east, Guyana to the west, and Brazil to the south. At just under 165,000 square kilometers (64,000 square miles), it is the smallest sovereign state in South America.

Situated slightly north of the equator, Suriname is a tropical country dominated by rainforests. Its extensive tree cover is vital to the country's efforts to mitigate climate change and maintain carbon negativity. A developing country with a relatively high level of human development, Suriname's economy is heavily dependent on its abundant natural resources, namely bauxite, gold, petroleum, and agricultural products.

## Demography
Suriname was inhabited as early as the fourth millennium BC by various indigenous peoples, including the Arawaks, Caribs, and Wayana. Europeans arrived in the 16th century, with the Dutch establishing control over much of the country's current territory by the late 17th century. During the Dutch colonial period, Suriname was a lucrative source of sugar, its plantation economy driven by African slave labour, and after abolition of slavery in 1863, by indentured servants from Asia, predominantly from then British India, as well as the Dutch East Indies.

## Colonial history
In 1954, Suriname became one of the constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. On 25 November 1975, it left the Kingdom to become an independent state. Contrary to the preceding war for independence of Dutch colony Indonesia, this was an initiative of the Netherlands' then left-wing government. Suriname continues to maintain close diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties with the Netherlands.

## Language
Suriname is considered a culturally Caribbean country, and is a member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). It is the only sovereign nation outside of Europe where Dutch is the official and prevailing language of government, business, media, and education. According to research by the Dutch Language Union, Dutch is the native language of 60% of Surinamese. Sranan Tongo, an English-based creole language, is a widely used lingua franca.

## Independence
The first President of the country was *Johan Ferrier*, the former governor, with *Henck Arron* (the then leader of the NPS) as Prime Minister. In the years leading up to independence, nearly 1/3 of the population of Suriname emigrated to the Netherlands, amidst concern that the new country would fare worse under independence than it had as a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. 

Surinamese politics did degenerate into ethnic polarisation and corruption soon after independence, with the NPS using Dutch aid money for partisan purposes. Its leaders were accused of fraud in the 1977 elections, in which Arron won a further term, and the discontent was such that a large portion of the population fled to the Netherlands, joining the already significant Surinamese community there.

## Coup in 1980
On 25 February 1980, a military coup overthrew Arron's government. It was initiated by a group of 16 sergeants, led by D√©si Bouterse.[14] Opponents of the military regime attempted counter-coups in April 1980, August 1980, 15 March 1981, and again on 12 March 1982. The first counter attempt was led by Fred Ormskerk,[35] the second by Marxist-Leninists,[36] the third by Wilfred Hawker, and the fourth by Surendre Rambocus.

Hawker escaped from prison during the fourth counter-coup attempt, but he was captured and summarily executed. Between 2 am and 5 am on 7 December 1982, the military, under Bouterse's leadership, rounded up 13 prominent citizens who had criticized the military dictatorship and held them at Fort Zeelandia in Paramaribo.[37] The dictatorship had all these men executed over the next three days, along with Rambocus and Jiwansingh Sheombar (who was also involved in the fourth counter-coup attempt).
