## Problem solving
- A problem-solving methodology that we will learn in the course: – Formulating a real-world problem in computational terms
	- Characterizing the difficulty or complexity of the problem
	- Finding ways (algorithms) to solve the problem efficiently
- By the end of the course, you are expected to be able to carry out a similar problem-solving methodology for this and other problems

## Course focus
- Design
- Complexity  
- Efficiency and scalability

#### Skills focus
-  Problem formulation  
- Problem-solving methods – Real-world applications
