According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), FGM is prevalent in a number of countries in Africa, including **Egypt, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan**. It is also practiced in some countries in the **Middle East and Asia, including Indonesia, Iraq, and Yemen.**

In some countries, this issue is especially dominant:
1. In Mali and Egypt, 91% of women (15 to 49 years-old) undergo FGM

An estimated 200 million girls and women alive today are believed to have been subjected to FGM; but rates of FGM are increasing, a reflection of global population growth. Girls and women who have undergone FGM live predominately in sub-Saharan Africa and the Arab States, but FGM is also practiced in select countries in Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. It is also practiced among migrant populations throughout Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand.

UNFPA-UNICEF Joint Programme on Female Genital Mutilation works with 17 countries to reduce the rates of FGM.

In recent years, a number of countries have taken steps to ban the practice of FGM and to protect girls and women from the practice. Some examples of countries that have recently banned FGM include:
- The United Kingdom: 
	- FGM has been illegal in the UK since 1985, and the law was strengthened in 2003 to make it a criminal offense to carry out FGM or to arrange for someone else to carry it out, even if it takes place abroad 
- The United States: 
	- FGM has been illegal in the US since 1996, and the law was strengthened in 2013 to make it a federal crime to transport a minor out of the country for the purpose of FGM.
- Australia: 
	- FGM has been illegal in Australia since 1994, and the law was strengthened in 2018 to make it a criminal offense to perform FGM on an Australian citizen or permanent resident, regardless of where the procedure takes place.
- France: 
	- FGM has been illegal in France since 1983, and the law was strengthened in 2016 to make it a criminal offense to take a child abroad for the purpose of FGM.

## Complications
FGM has been show to increase risk of HIV transmission, fetal death and obstetric fistula. Psychological stress from undergoing FGM also can complicate fetal development.

## Ethnicity and culture
Some argue FGM ought to be permitted on the grounds of protecting culture and ethnically related rights.

Ethnicity has been the main determinant in whether someone undergoes FGM.
	- Among ethnically somali population, for example, countries have demonstrated varying proliferation of FGM
		- Among Kenyan Somali, FGM rate is 94%
		- Among Somalian Somali, the rate is 99%
		- Among all Kenyans, the same rate is lower at 21%

## Urban-rural divide
There are exceptions to the ethnic determinant. In Senegal, there are major variations in FGM prevalence among Mandingue women depending on where they live â€“ 
- 56% in urban areas vs 
- 79% in rural areas. 
Similarly, FGM prevalence among the Poular ranges from 39% in urban areas to 67% in rural areas.
