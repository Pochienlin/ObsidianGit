## Angle
- Assumes the readers have more time to read and can go further to understand point of the story
	- Writer's challenge is engagement
- Mvoe beyond relevant facts to detail and description; often contain human interest element

## Feature story structures
- Anecdotal features
	- Start with story, then facts and quotes
- Suspended interest features
	- Leading paragraphs raise questions; readers must read on to solve the puzzle
``` ad-example
SMU student Andy Lim was walking to his class last Friday when he heard a rustling in the bushes
```
- Profiles
	- Focuses on a person (their life or an aspect of their life)
	- Should be reserved for noteworthy people with interesting life
- Questions and answer: starts with explanatory paragraph, then goes into Q&A
> [!example]
> Interviewing a doctor during COVID variant outbreak

## Writing
- Lighter read and more entertaining
	- 5 senses
- Describe actions, people, places
- Inject more personal tone or voice
	- E.g. "this is a sight to behold"
	- Words that may never show up in a news story
- Use quotations to bring out the people in the story

## Lead
- Not bound by one-sentence, 30-words
- Key is to catch reader attention and to hold it
	- Offers some information of substance
	- Lead towards the point the story is trying to make 
	- Interest the reader on the subject
## Engine paragraph and body
- Engine: 
	- Offers some payoff, context and sets the stage for the story
		- By the time one reaches the engine paragraph, the writer should spell something out clearly for the reader
		- Gives the reader enough reasons to read on 
- Body: 
	- Expands and offers details on what is mentioned in the lead
	- Should answer all questions for the reader 
	- Plug all gaps
## Ending
- May offer perspective, answer lingering questions, or make a final points
- May also end with an impactful quote
- Stop writing when there is nothing of substance to say
