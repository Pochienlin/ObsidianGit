-   Implementation execution â€“ how to do
-   Post-check â€“ smoke test, user sign off
-   Rollback â€“ what is it, how to do it, testing before and after
-   Clean up â€“ ensure all test data is removed, remove install scripts

## **During the actual implementation check:**
- [ ]  **Backups completed successfully** - code, configuration and data
- [ ] **Changes implemented** the components - working through the implementation steps in the hour-byhour plan.
- [ ] **Test** the implementation. If not okay then rollback and test the rollback.
- [ ] Get **sign off** that implementation succeeded from:
	- [ ]  The requester of the change - all is as expected
	- [ ]  The support manager - ready to support from now
