## Ethno-sectarian confessionalism
Ethno-sectarian confessionalism in Iraq refers to the way in which the country's political system is based on the distribution of power and representation among the different ethnic and sectarian groups within the country. This system, which is also known as "power-sharing," is intended to promote stability and reduce tensions between the different groups.

However, ethno-sectarian confessionalism in Iraq has also been a source of tension and conflict within the country. Some critics argue that the system reinforces and entrenches ethnic and sectarian divisions, and can lead to political instability and corruption. Others argue that the system does not adequately represent the interests of all groups within the country, and can lead to the marginalization and exclusion of certain groups.

- The majority of the population in Iraq is Shia Muslim, while the Sunni Muslim minority has historically held a disproportionate amount of power and influence in the country.
	- This has led to tensions between the two groups, and has been a major factor in the ongoing conflicts and political instability in the country.
- The Kurdish minority, which is predominantly Sunni Muslim, has also faced discrimination and marginalization, and has sought greater autonomy and self-determination within Iraq.
- The Kurds are the biggest ethnic groups without their own country. This happened because the borders in the Middle East were drawn without consideration for Kurdish interest
