## Overview
CTQ trees are the key measurable characteristics of a product or process whose performance standards or specification limits must be met in order to satisfy the customer. They align improvement or design efforts with customer requirements.

CTQs are used to decompose broadÂ customerÂ requirements Â into more easily quantified elements. CTQ trees are often used as part ofÂ [[Six Sigma]]methodology to help prioritize such requirements.

CTQs represent the product or service characteristics as defined by the customer/user. Customers may be surveyed to elicit quality, service and performance data. They may include upper and lower specification limits or any other factors. A CTQ must be an actionable, quantitative business specification.

CTQs reflect the expressed needs of the customer. Services and products are typically not monolithic. They must be decomposed into constituent elements (tasks in the cases of services).

CTQs represent the product or service characteristics defined by the customer (internal or external). They may include:
- Upper and lower specification limits
- Must be interpreted from quantitative business specifications that drives a qualitative customer statement (CTQ Tree).
- Qualitative customer statement is also called the Voice of the Customer (VoC)
