## Overview
The ship of fools is an allegory, originating from Book VI of Plato's Republic, about a ship with a dysfunctional crew. The allegory is intended to represent the problems of governance prevailing in a political system not based on expert knowledge.

> [!quote] from The Republic
> Thereâ€™s the shipowner, larger and stronger than everyone in the ship, but somewhat deaf and rather short-sighted, with a knowledge of sailing to match his eyesight. The sailors are quarrelling among themselves over captaincy of the ship, each one thinking that he ought to be captain, though he has never learnt that skill, nor can he point to the person who taught him or a time when he was learning it. 
> 
> On top of which they say it canâ€™t be taught. In fact theyâ€™re prepared to cut to pieces anyone who says it can. The shipowner himself is always surrounded by them. They beg him and do everything they can to make him hand over the tiller to them. Sometimes, if other people can persuade him and they canâ€™t, they kill those others or throw them overboard. 
> 
> Then they immobilise their worthy shipowner with drugs or drink or by some other means, and take control of the ship, helping themselves to what it is carrying. Drinking and feasting, they sail in the way youâ€™d expect people like that to sail. More than that, if someone is good at finding them ways of persuading or compelling the shipowner to let them take control, they call him a real seaman, a real captain, and say he really knows about ships. Anyone who canâ€™t do this they treat with contempt, calling him useless. 
> 
> They donâ€™t even begin to understand that if he is to be truly fit to take command of a ship a real shipâ€™s captain must of necessity be thoroughly familiar with the seasons of the year, the stars in the sky, the winds, and everything to do with his art. As for how he is going to steer the ship - regardless of whether anyone wants him to or not - they do not regard this as an additional skill or study which can be acquired over and above the art of being a shipâ€™s captain. If this is the situation on board, donâ€™t you think the person who is genuinely equipped to be captain will be called a stargazer, a chatterer, of no use to them, by those who sail in ships with this kind of crew? 

# Implications
The allegory of the ship demonstrates that those who are worthy of leadership are often not the ones who are favoured by the masses. The capable captain who is able to navigate the ship is called a "stargazer" and good-for-nothing, just as a capable leader often requires knowledge that may not appear attractive in leadership at first blush. Plato believes this skill to be specifically referring to philosophy: A philosopher is by nature a lover of truth, and so no one else is better suited for a task so noble as one who dedicates his mind and soul to loving truth.

Likewise, just as the captain may be disinterested in the games of power led by the crew, a worthy leader often shies away from positions of power, and as a result, those who thirst for power are usually the unworthy ones who sway the masses to hand them power, because they tend to be more local. Those who are worthy and thirst not for power instead tend not to be surfaced in mass rule.
