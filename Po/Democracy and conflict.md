## Democracy
> [!abstract] Definition
> rule of the people, by the people, for the people. 
- values universal suffrage and majority rule

- associative autonomy 
- inclusive citizenship 

## Dahl’s Polyarchy

### Polyarchy vs Democracy
Democracy looks to invest power within a representative few, forming a check and balance system between the electorate and the elected. On the other hand, Polyarchy achieves checks and balances by diversting power to various different parties and institution, achieving fairness by decentralizing power in an adversarial system rather than centralizing in a trusted few.

Both looks to free, fair, and frequent elections as a necessity, while universal sufferage is necessary for a polyarchic set up and encouraged in most forms of democracy. In addition, polyarchy emphasizes on the presence and efficacy of alternative sources of information.

There has been limited benchmarks for degrees of polyarchy, although democratic systems that are adversarial gravitate towards polyarchic ideals. Non-democratic polyarchy also exist, where a competitive oligarchy can also be argued as a form of polyarchy.
  

## Double turnover test 
- democracy is strong when 2 successive elected governments are able to complete their terms in office without being removed via coup or other undemocratic methods
- Huntington 1968 “burden of democracy” argued democracy is only as strong as its ability to maintain power via regular elections and peaceful transfer of power. Ability to complete two consecutive turnover tests was the best way to measure strength if a democracy

 ## Religion and democracy
- Values can overlap with democratic values (sanctity of life, universal sainthood, being against oppression etc) but adherence to a non individualistic culture may be conflated with antidemocratic teachings at times
- international panel for social progress concludes religion is neither inherently pro or anti democratic 
### Christianity and democracy
- **Alexis de Tocqueville** writes Catholics constitute most republican and most democratic class of citizens in the US because Catholicism emphasizes on equality 
- **Seymour Martin Lipset** argues otherwise, because religion claims monopoly on truth but democracy requires competition of ideas 
### Islam and democracy
- **Montesquieu** claims “moderate” gov are better suited to Christians, while “despotic” gigs are suited to “Mohammedanism”
- **Huntington** claimed the same that Islamic concepts of pol contradict democratic premises  
- grounds are mixed: mass attitudes towards religion and democracy in Algeria Egypt Morocco and Palestine (Tessler) found Islam is not the obstacle to democratization that some western scholars allege it to be. 
- in **Egypt and Jordan survey** data shows vast majority demonstrate simultaneous support for Islam and demo

### War on terror
- foreign aid to Iraq afghan Pakistan
- Kurds in Iraq and turkey -> western hypocrisy 
	-  US largely turns blind eye to turk repression of Kurd minorities. Regarded them as threat to National security and responded demands for autonomy with oppressive policies and military force. US provided them arms to fight Kurds despite human right abuses.
