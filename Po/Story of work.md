 People struggled with mundane and repetitive tasks before automation and  RPA has made work easy and exciting.

> [!quote] the story of work
> This is the story of work. It started a long time ago on a Monday, which was handy. For as long as history itself, humans needed to work. They wanted to work, to grow things and create things and build things. To see what they were capable of. To stand at day's end and say, I did that. Which felt pretty good. 
> 
> So they worked more, built more and created more, and traveled to far-off places. Then someone suggested submitting expense reports for those in far-off places. His name was Glen and he was a jackass. Anyway, the people kept getting better at work. They built better tools to work more efficiently. They build amazing machines to work faster. They built computers to work smarter. 
> 
> But still they couldn't do enough work. Because during all that work to do more work, they had created work and not the good kind. Not the, "Let's sit around and come up with ideas." Not the, "I can't wait to get to work so I can jump into a new project," the crap kind. The drudge and the data and admin and the damned expense reports. The humans have to work more at work they didn't like. 
> 
> That made them robotic. That didn't inspire. They had to postpone vacations. They had to miss family dinners. They were pissed. 
> 
> Then something happened. Someone had a really amazing idea. They came into work and said, "Stop working and start working." The humans thought she might have had wine at lunch. She showed them a way to put the family back into work. To waste less time doing the things they hated, to make more efficient the big tasks. To stop making the humans act like robots and start teaching the robots to learn the humans. Not to replace people, but to free them.

> Robots that learn you, Imagine the potential. Like starting over to help us remember again, that work only really works when we're happy at it.
