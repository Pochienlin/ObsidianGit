## # Service Level Agreement:
```ad-abstract
title: what is an SLA?
a documented commitment between a service provider and a customer.
```

A SLA captures the following aspects:

- Service description
- Service level targets: availability, latency, throughput, etc.
- Responsibilities of both service provider and customer

SLAs must be **SMART**:

- **S**pecific: detailed enough to define expectations
- **M**easurable: must be able to track actual performance
- **A**chievable: realistic and practical to obtain
- **R**elevant: directly related to the service being delivered
- **T**imely: a time frame against which the service will be delivered

## Example of SLAs
