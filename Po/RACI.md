## What is a RACI matrix?
The RACI matrix is a responsiblity assignment chart that maps out every task, milestone or key decision involved in completing a project and assigns which roles are _Responsible_ for each action item, which personnel are _Accountable_, and, where appropriate, who needs to be _Consulted_ or Informed. The acronym RACI stands for the four roles that stakeholders might play in any project.

## Responsible
```ad-abstract
People or stakeholders who do the work. 
```
They must complete the task or objective or make the decision. Several people can be jointly _Responsible_.
- Contractor
## Accountable
```ad-abstract
Person or stakeholder who is the “owner” of the work.
```
He or she must sign off or approve when the task, objective or decision is complete. This person must make sure that responsibilities are assigned in the matrix for all related activities. Success requires that there is only one person _Accountable_, which means that “the buck stops there.”
- Product/ Process owner
- ESM team
## Consulted
People or stakeholders who need to give input before the work can be done and signed-off on. These people are “in the loop” and active participants.

## Informed
People or stakeholders who need to be kept “in the picture.” They need updates on progress or decisions, but they do not need to be formally consulted, nor do they contribute directly to the task or decision.
