DMADV's five steps

Main article: [DFSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFSS "DFSS")

Also known as DFSS ("**D**esign **F**or **S**ix **S**igma"), the DMADV methodology's five phases are:[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Sigma#cite_note-Juran-6)

-   _**D**efine_ design goals that are consistent with customer demands and the enterprise strategy.
-   _**M**easure_ and identify CTQs (characteristics that are **C**ritical **T**o **Q**uality), measure product capabilities, production process capability, and measure risks.
-   _**A**nalyze_ to develop and design alternatives
-   _**D**esign_ an improved alternative, best suited per analysis in the previous step
-   _**V**erify_ the design, set up pilot runs, implement the production process and hand it over to the process owner(s).
