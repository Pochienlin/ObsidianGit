## Education
The dropout rate in India's education system is relatively high, particularly at the primary and secondary levels. According to data from the Ministry of Education...
1. the dropout rate at the **primary** level is around **20%,**  
2. the dropout rate at the **secondary** level is around **50%.** 
There are a number of factors that contribute to the high dropout rate in India, including poverty, lack of access to education, and inadequate infrastructure and resources.

This drop out rate is also attributable to the government's focus on tertiary education institution, which generates better optics for politicians. Insufficient resources have been allocated to improving lower levels of education as well.

### Gender divide
There is also a significant gap in literacy rates between men and women in India. According to data from the Census of India, 
+ the literacy rate for men in India is around 82%, 
+ the literacy rate for women is around 65%. 
This gap is influenced by a number of factors, including cultural and social norms that prioritize education for boys over girls, and lack of access to education for girls in some parts of the country.

### Urban-rural divide
- Educational attainment: higher in urban areas and with men.

## Caste system
Under the caste system, people are born into a particular caste and are expected to marry and work within that caste. The caste system has traditionally been based on the principle of endogamy, which means that people are expected to marry within their own caste. The caste system has also traditionally been based on the principle of graded inequality, which means that different castes are ranked in a hierarchy, with higher castes being considered superior to lower castes.  

The caste system has perpetuated inequality in a number of ways. For example, the caste system has traditionally been used to discriminate against lower castes and to exclude them from education, employment, and other opportunities. The caste system has also been used to justify violence and abuse against lower castes, and has been a source of significant social and economic disadvantage.

Despite efforts to dismantle the caste system and promote equality, the caste system continues to have a significant impact on social, economic, and political life in India and other parts of South Asia. The caste system remains a deeply entrenched and controversial issue, and addressing and combating its harmful effects remains a major challenge for the region.

## Witch Hunt in India
According to a report from the United Nations, witch hunting is a serious issue in India, and is often motivated by a range of factors including greed, jealousy, and social tensions. Witch hunting is often used as a way to settle disputes or to take revenge, and is often perpetrated by local leaders or influential individuals.

Witch hunting has been reported in a number of states in India, including Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and Odisha. In these states, witch hunting has been used to justify violence and abuse against women, and has resulted in a number of deaths and injuries.

Overall, while the practice of witch hunting has declined significantly in many parts of the world, it is still an issue in some parts of India and other parts of South Asia, and is often motivated by a range of factors including greed, jealousy, and social tensions.
