## Ethnic conflicts
bipolar society is Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a country in the Balkans that is divided into two entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is predominantly Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) and Croat, and the Republika Srpska, which is predominantly Serb.

The country has a long history of ethnic and political conflict, and the divisions between the Bosniak, Croat, and Serb communities have shaped the social and political landscape of the country. These divisions were exacerbated by the Bosnian War (1992-1995), which was characterized by widespread violence and ethnic cleansing, and have continued to shape the country's politics and society in the years since the war.

The bipolar nature of Bosnia and Herzegovina's society is reflected in the country's power-sharing system, which is based on the principle of ethnic quotas and allocates a certain number of seats in the government and other public institutions to each of the three main ethnic groups. This system has been criticized for entrenching ethnic divisions and contributing to political instability in the country.
