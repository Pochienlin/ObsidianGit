## Resource curse/ Dutch Disease
Nigeria is a country with abundant oil reserves and has been a major exporter of oil for decades. However, rather than driving economic development, the oil industry has contributed to poverty and inequality in Nigeria.  

There are several reasons why the resource curse has affected Nigeria.Â 
1. oil industry has often been characterized by corruption and mismanagement, with a small elite group benefiting from the wealth generated by the oil industry while the majority of the population has not seen significant improvements in their living standards.Â 
2. oil industry has often led to environmental degradation, including pollution and the depletion of natural resources, which has had negative impacts on the health and well-being of the local population.

The international order has also played a role in the resource curse in Nigeria.Â 
1. The global demand for oil has fueled the growth of the oil industry in Nigeria and has contributed to the country's reliance on oil exports.Â 
2. the international economic system put in place trade policies and investment flows that incentivises resource export at the expense of other sectors.

This results in poor linkages between resource-driven and non-resource-driven sectors

### Political reasons for inertia
1. Short-sightedness of politicians incentivises them to earn quick money by exploiting the countryâ€™s natural resources to bolster their performance
2. Few in-groups are empowered from the resource curse and politically do what they can to stay in power
3. Weakened state-institutions form a vicious cycle with all above factors

## Divisions
1. Ethnic divide: nigeria has 250 ethnic groups and languages
	- Hausa-Fulani in the north and the Yoruba and Igbo in the south.Â 
		- colonial history: Nigeria was divided into several administrative regions, and different ethnic groups were often favored by the colonial authorities.Â 
		- This has contributed to a sense of historical resentment and mistrust between different ethnic groups.
	
		Ethnic division in Nigeria has also been fueled by political and economic factors.Â 
		- political power has often been concentrated in the hands of a small elite group, and this has often been associated with a particular ethnic group.Â 
		- economic resources have often been concentrated in certain regions of the country, which has led to resentment and conflict between different ethnic groups.
