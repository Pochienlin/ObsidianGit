**Ishikawa diagrams** (also called **fishbone diagrams**, **herringbone diagrams**, **cause-and-effect diagrams**, or **Fishikawa**) are [causal diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_diagram "Causal diagram") created by [Kaoru Ishikawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaoru_Ishikawa "Kaoru Ishikawa") that show the potential [causes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cause "Cause") of a specific event.

## Structure
The _defect_ is shown as the fish's head, facing to the right, with the _causes_ extending to the left as fishbones; the ribs branch off the backbone for major causes, with sub-branches for root-causes, to as many levels as required.

Ishikawa diagrams were popularized in the 1960s by [Kaoru Ishikawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaoru_Ishikawa "Kaoru Ishikawa"),who pioneered quality management processes in the [Kawasaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawasaki_Heavy_Industries "Kawasaki Heavy Industries") shipyards, and in the process became one of the founding fathers of modern management.

The basic concept was first used in the 1920s, and is considered one of the [seven basic tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Basic_Tools_of_Quality "Seven Basic Tools of Quality") of [quality control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_control "Quality control").It is known as a fishbone diagram because of its shape, similar to the side view of a fish skeleton.

[Mazda Motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda "Mazda") famously used an Ishikawa diagram in the development of the [Miata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda_MX-5_Miata "Mazda MX-5 Miata") ([MX5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda_MX-5 "Mazda MX-5")) sports car.

### Advantages
-   Highly visual brainstorming tool which can spark further examples of root causes
-   Quickly identify if the root cause is found multiple times in the same or different causal tree
-   Allows one to see all causes simultaneously
-   Good visualization for presenting issues to stakeholders

### Disadvantages
-   Complex defects might yield a lot of causes which might become visually cluttering
-   Interrelationships between causes are not easily identifiable[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishikawa_diagram#cite_note-6)

### Common uses
Common uses of the Ishikawa diagram are [product design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_design "Product design") and quality defect prevention to identify potential factors causing an overall effect. Each cause or reason for imperfection is a source of variation. Causes are usually grouped into major categories to identify and classify these sources of variation.

## Frameworks
### 5/8 Ms (Used in manufacturing)
Originating with lean manufacturing and the [Toyota Production System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System "Toyota Production System"), the 5 Ms is one of the most common frameworks for root-cause analysis.
-   Manpower / mind power (physical or knowledge work, includes: [kaizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen "Kaizen"), suggestions)
-   Machine (equipment, technology)
-   Material (includes raw material, consumables, and information)
-   Method (process)
-   Measurement / medium (inspection, environment)

These have been expanded by some to include an additional three, and are referred to as the 8 Ms:
-   Mission / mother nature (purpose, environment)
-   Management / money power (leadership)
-   Maintenance

### 8Ps (Used in product marketing)
This common model for identifying crucial attributes for planning in product marketing is often also used in root-cause analysis as categories for the Ishikawa diagram.
-   Product (or service)
-   Price
-   Place
-   Promotion
-   People (personnel)
-   Process
-   Physical evidence (proof)
-   Performance


### 4/5S (used in service industries)
An alternative used for service industries, uses four categories of possible cause.
-   Surroundings
-   Suppliers
-   Systems
-   Skill
-   (5th S) Safety

# In-class example

A fishbone diagram, also called Ishikawa or cause-and-effect diagram, is a way to progressively break down potential causes of a problem:

1. Causes are grouped into categories
2. Create possible causes under each category
- Helps to understand and visualize the relationships between the causes.
- Help with troubleshooting documentation.

Can be used along with 5-why analysis

## Example: email service
Email slow, then systematically check:
1. Authentication
2. Server components
3. Client components
4. Network components

**Use with other methods**
