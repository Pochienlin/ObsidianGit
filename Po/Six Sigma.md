- Based on the methods taught by W. Edwards Deming.
- Developed by Motorola and Bill Smith in the early 1980â€™s.
- Popularised at General Electric (GE) with Jack Welch in the early 1990â€™s.
- Thousands of companies around the world have adopted Six Sigma as a way of doing business, including SMU.

Six Sigma strategies seek to improve [manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing "Manufacturing") quality by identifying and removing the causes of defects and minimizing [variability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_dispersion "Statistical dispersion") in manufacturing and [business processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process "Business process"). This is done by using empirical and statistical [quality management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_management "Quality management") methods and by hiring people who serve as Six Sigma experts. Each Six Sigma project follows a defined methodology and has specific value targets, such as reducing pollution or increasing [customer satisfaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_satisfaction "Customer satisfaction").

The term _Six Sigma_ originates from statistical modeling of manufacturing [processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_capability "Process capability"). The maturity of a manufacturing process can be described by a _sigma_ rating indicating its yield or the percentage of defect-free products it createsâ€”specifically, to within how many standard deviations of a [normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution "Normal distribution") the fraction of defect-free outcomes corresponds.

### Etymology
The term Six Sigma comes from [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics"), specifically from the field of [statistical quality control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_quality_control "Statistical quality control"), which evaluates [process capability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_capability "Process capability"). Originally, it referred to the ability of manufacturing processes to produce a very high proportion of output within specification. Processes that operate with "six sigma quality" over the short term are assumed to produce long-term defect levels below 3.4 [defects per million opportunities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defects_per_million_opportunities "Defects per million opportunities") (DPMO). The 3.4 dpmo is based on a "shift" of Â± 1.5 sigma explained by [Mikel Harry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Harry "Mikel Harry"). This figure is based on the tolerance in the height of a stack of discs.

Specifically, say that there are six [standard deviations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation "Standard deviation")â€”represented by the [Greek letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet "Greek alphabet") Ïƒ ([sigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma "Sigma"))â€”between the [mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean "Mean")â€”represented by Î¼ ([mu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_(letter) "Mu (letter)"))â€”and the nearest specification limit. As process standard deviation goes up, or the mean of the process moves away from the center of the tolerance, fewer standard deviations will fit between the mean and the nearest specification limit, decreasing the sigma number and increasing the likelihood of items outside specification. According to a calculation method employed in [process capability studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_capability "Process capability"), this means that practically no[_[failed verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability "Wikipedia:Verifiability")_] items will fail to meet specifications.

One should also note that the calculation of Sigma levels for a process data is independent of the data being [normally distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distributions "Normal distributions"). In one of the criticisms of Six Sigma, practitioners using this approach spend a lot of time transforming data from non-normal to normal using transformation techniques. It must be said that Sigma levels can be determined for process data that has evidence of non-normality.

# Doctrine
Six Sigma asserts that:
-   Continuous efforts to achieve stable and predictable process results (e.g., by reducing process [variation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_dispersion "Statistical dispersion")) are of vital importance to business success.
-   Manufacturing and business processes have characteristics that can be defined, measured, analyzed, improved, and controlled.
-   Achieving sustained quality improvement requires commitment from the entire organization, particularly from top-level management.

Features that set Six Sigma apart from previous quality-improvement initiatives include:
-   Focus on achieving measurable and quantifiable financial returns
-   Emphasis on management leadership and support
-   Commitment to making decisions on the basis of verifiable data and statistical methods rather than assumptions and guesswork

In fact, [lean management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_management "Lean management") and Six Sigma share similar methodologies and tools, including the fact that both were influenced by [Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Japan "Culture of Japan") business culture. However, lean management primarily focuses on eliminating waste through tools that target organizational efficiencies while integrating a performance improvement system, while Six Sigma focuses on eliminating defects and reducing variation. Both systems are driven by data, though Six Sigma is much more dependent on accurate data.

Six Sigma's implicit goal is to improve all processes but not necessarily to the 3.4 DPMO level. Organizations need to determine an appropriate sigma level for each of their most important processes and strive to achieve these. As a result of this goal, it is incumbent on management of the organization to prioritize areas of improvement.

### Methodologies
Six Sigma projects follow two project methodologies, inspired by [W. Edwards Deming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming "W. Edwards Deming")'s [Planâ€“Doâ€“Studyâ€“Act Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA "PDCA"), each with five phases.

-   [[DMAIC]] ("duh-may-ick", /dÉ™.ËˆmeÉª.Éªk/) is used for projects aimed at improving an existing business process
-   [[DMADV]] ("duh-mad-vee", /dÉ™.ËˆmÃ¦d.vi/) is used for projects aimed at creating new product or process designs

## Criticism
While there are many advocates for a Six Sigma approach for the reasons stated above, not all projects are successful: in 2010, the Wall Street Journal reported that more than 60% of projects fail. A review of academic literature found 34 common failure factors in 56 papers on Lean, Six Sigma, and LSS from 1995-2013. Among them are (summarized):
-   Lack of top management attitude, commitment, and involvement; lack of leadership and vision
-   Lack of training and education; lack of resources (financial, technical, human, etc.)
-   Poor project selection and prioritization; weak link to strategic objectives of the organization
-   Resistance to culture change; Poor communication; Lack of consideration of the human factors
-   Lack of awareness of the benefits of Lean/Six Sigma; Lack of technical understanding of tools, techniques, and practices

Others have provided other criticisms.

### Lack of originality

Quality expert [Joseph M. Juran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_M._Juran "Joseph M. Juran") described Six Sigma as "a basic version of quality improvement", stating that "there is nothing new there. It includes what we used to call facilitators. They've adopted more flamboyant terms, like belts with different colors. I think that concept has merit to set apart, to create specialists who can be very helpful. Again, that's not a new idea. The [American Society for Quality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_for_Quality "American Society for Quality") long ago established certificates, such as for [reliability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_engineering "Reliability engineering") engineers."

### Inadequate for complex manufacturing
Quality expert [Philip B. Crosby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_B._Crosby "Philip B. Crosby") pointed out that the Six Sigma standard does not go far enoughâ€”customers deserve [defect-free products every time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_Defects "Zero Defects").For example, under the Six Sigma standard, [semiconductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor "Semiconductor"), which require the flawless etching of millions of tiny circuits onto a single chip are all defective.

### Role of consultants
The use of "Black Belts" as itinerant change agents has fostered an industry of training and certification. Critics have argued there is overselling of Six Sigma by too great a number of consulting firms, many of which claim expertise in Six Sigma when they have only a rudimentary understanding of the tools and techniques involved or the markets or industries in which they are acting.

### Potential negative effects
A _[Fortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(magazine) "Fortune (magazine)")_ article stated that "of 58 large companies that have announced Six Sigma programs, 91% have trailed the [S&P 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500 "S&P 500") since". The statement was attributed to "an analysis by Charles Holland of consulting firm [Qualpro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualpro "Qualpro") (which espouses a competing quality-improvement process)". The summary of the article is that Six Sigma is effective at what it is intended to do, but that it is "narrowly designed to fix an existing process" and does not help in "coming up with new products or disruptive technologies.

### Over-reliance on statistics
More direct criticism is the "rigid" nature of Six Sigma with its over-reliance on methods and tools. In most cases, more attention is paid to reducing variation and searching for any significant factors, and less attention is paid to developing robustness in the first place (which can altogether eliminate the need for reducing variation).

The extensive reliance on significance testing and use of multiple regression techniques increase the risk of making commonly unknown types of statistical errors or mistakes. A possible consequence of Six Sigma's array of [_p_-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value "P-value") misconceptions is the false belief that the probability of a conclusion being in error can be calculated from the data in a single experiment without reference to external evidence or the plausibility of the underlying mechanism. 

One of the most serious but all-too-common misuses of inferential statistics is to take a model that was developed through exploratory model building and subject it to the same sorts of statistical tests that are used to validate a model that was specified in advance.

Another comment refers to the oft-mentioned Transfer Function, which seems to be a flawed theory if looked at in detail. Since significance tests were first popularized many objections have been voiced by prominent and respected statisticians. The volume of criticism and rebuttal has filled books with language seldom used in the scholarly debate of a dry subject. Much of the first criticism was already published more than 40 years ago (see [Statistical hypothesis testing Â§Â Criticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing#Criticism "Statistical hypothesis testing")).

In a 2006 issue _USA Army Logistician_ an article critical of Six Sigma noted: "The dangers of a single paradigmatic orientation (in this case, that of technical rationality) can blind us to values associated with [double-loop learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-loop_learning "Double-loop learning") and the [learning organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_organization "Learning organization"), [organization adaptability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptability "Adaptability"), workforce creativity and development, humanizing the workplace, [cultural awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_competence "Cultural competence"), and strategy making.

[Nassim Nicholas Taleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb "Nassim Nicholas Taleb") considers risk managers little more than "blind users" of statistical tools and methods. He states that statistics is fundamentally incomplete as a field as it cannot predict the risk of rare eventsâ€”something Six Sigma is especially concerned with. Furthermore, errors in prediction are likely to occur as a result of ignorance of or distinction between epistemic and other uncertainties. These errors are the biggest in time variant ([reliability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_engineering "Reliability engineering")) related failures.

### 1.5 sigma shift

The statistician [Donald J. Wheeler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_J._Wheeler "Donald J. Wheeler") has dismissed the 1.5 sigma shift as "goofy" because of its arbitrary nature. Its universal applicability is seen as doubtful.

The 1.5 sigma shift has also become contentious because it results in stated "sigma levels" that reflect short-term rather than long-term performance: a process that has long-term defect levels corresponding to 4.5 sigma performance is, by Six Sigma convention, described as a "six sigma process". The accepted Six Sigma scoring system thus cannot be equated to actual normal distribution probabilities for the stated number of standard deviations, and this has been a key bone of contention over how Six Sigma measures are defined. The fact that it is rarely explained that a "6 sigma" process will have long-term defect rates corresponding to 4.5 sigma performance rather than actual 6 sigma performance has led several commentators to express the opinion that Six Sigma is a [confidence trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick "Confidence trick").

### Stifling creativity in research

According to John Dodge, editor in chief of _Design News_, the use of Six Sigma is inappropriate in a research environment. Dodge states "excessive metrics, steps, measurements and Six Sigma's intense focus on reducing variability water down the discovery process. Under Six Sigma, the free-wheeling nature of brainstorming and the serendipitous side of discovery is stifled." He concludes "there's general agreement that freedom in basic or pure research is preferable while Six Sigma works best in incremental innovation when there's an expressed commercial goal."

A _[BusinessWeek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BusinessWeek "BusinessWeek")_ article says that [James McNerney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_McNerney "James McNerney")'s introduction of Six Sigma at [3M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3M "3M") had the effect of stifling creativity and reports its removal from the research function. It cites two [Wharton School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wharton_School_of_the_University_of_Pennsylvania "Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania") professors who say that Six Sigma leads to incremental innovation at the expense of [blue skies research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_skies_research "Blue skies research").This phenomenon is further explored in the book _Going Lean_, which describes a related approach known as [lean dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_dynamics "Lean dynamics") and provides data to show that [Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company "Ford Motor Company")'s 6 Sigma program did little to change its fortunes.

### Lack of documentation
One criticism voiced by Yasar Jarrar and [Andy Neely](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Andy_Neely&action=edit&redlink=1 "Andy Neely (page does not exist)") from the [Cranfield School of Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranfield_School_of_Management "Cranfield School of Management")'s Centre for Business Performance is that while Six Sigma is a powerful approach, it can also unduly dominate an organization's culture; and they add that much of the Six Sigma literature â€“ in a remarkable way (six-sigma claims to be evidence, scientifically based) â€“ lacks academic rigor:

> One final criticism, probably more to the Six Sigma literature than concepts, relates to the evidence for Six Sigmaâ€™s success. So far, documented case studies using the Six Sigma methods are presented as the strongest evidence for its success. However, looking at these documented cases, and apart from a few that are detailed from the experience of leading organizations like GE and Motorola, most cases are not documented in a systemic or academic manner. In fact, the majority are case studies illustrated on websites, and are, at best, sketchy. They provide no mention of any specific Six Sigma methods that were used to resolve the problems. It has been argued that by relying on the Six Sigma criteria, management is lulled into the idea that something is being done about quality, whereas any resulting improvement is accidental (Latzko 1995). Thus, when looking at the evidence put forward for Six Sigma's success, mostly by consultants and people with vested interests, the question that begs to be asked is: are we making a true improvement with Six Sigma methods or just getting skilled at telling stories? Everyone seems to believe that we are making true improvements, but there is some way to go to document these empirically and clarify the causal relations.
