An operating system (OS) is a low-level software system for managing and allocating computer hardware resources between applications running on the same machine.

OS also provides basic functions in the form of system calls (system APIs) for user-level applications.

- Windows - the most popular desktop operating systems
- Linux/Unix - ubiquitous in the server and embedded world
- Android - leading mobile/embedded OS
- iOS - Appleâ€™s mobile OS

## Example: Linux

Popular distributions: Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian.

- Kernel: the core of the OS, which is always running on top of the hardware and waiting for commands from users.

    - Examples: Bourne Shell, Korn Shell, etc.
    - Commands and utilities: cd, ps, grep, etc.
- Filesystem: organizing files and directories into a tree-like structure
