## Overview
> [!abstract]
> the model demonstrates how NGOs of the (predominantly) Third World work with international NGOs to address human rights violations in their own countries.

## How it works 
1. The model proposes that NGOs are crucial to balance and function in a functioning democracy
2. State A is an authoritarian regime
3. State B is one that allows for democratic CSO

## Criticisms
1. CSOs within authoritarian regimes in State A are likely not going to function smoothly and communicate with external CSOs
2. State B's power needs to be stronger than State A to have any likely semblance of the boomerang from taking off in the directions indicated
	1. Should State B be weaker than State A, the pressure is unlikely to to flow in such a way to coerce State A
