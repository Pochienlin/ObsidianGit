##  Ethics of international aid

### Global responsibility for poverty.
We are complicit in creating and maintaining the systems of global political and economic inequality that lead to poverty. 
- Pogge: current global economic system is “unjust” and that this creates a moral obligation on the part of those of us who benefit from the system to remedy the injustices it creates.
- Charles Beitz (2009): we should think of the world as a “cooperative venture for mutual advantage”
- Beitz (2009): or as a shared enterprise in which we are all engaged. He believes that we should therefore think of alleviating global poverty as a cooperative enterprise in which we all have a stake. 
	- Beitz also believes that we have a moral obligation to assist others when they are in need, even if they are not our “co-citizens.”
- Henry Shue (1980) argues that we have a moral obligation to assist others when they are in need, regardless of whether they are our “co-citizens,” because of the fundamental entitlements that all human beings have to life and to basic human rights.
#### Cosmopolitanism, communitarianism and contractarianism
- According to cosmopolitanism, justice is owed to all people regardless of where they live or where they were born.
- National boundaries are therefore of little or no moral importance in considerations of justice.
- Consequentialist philosophy assesses whether an action is morally just on the basis of the goodness or value of the outcomes it produces.
- Contractarian philosophy holds that moral norms are justified according to the idea of a contract or mutual agreement.
- Rights-based philosophy justifies moral claims on the basis of fundamental entitlements to act or be treated in specific ways.

- Pogge takes a contractarian approach and argues that the current global economic order is morally unjust because it causes massive and severe human rights deficits that could be avoided under a different and practically possible institutional arrangement.
- Rights-based approaches to global justice and the problem of poverty take the idea of human rights as implying duties for individuals, states, and other institutions to protect and aid those whose basic needs are not being met through contemporary global market economies.
- Communitarianism takes issue with the cosmopolitan assumption that national borders have no moral importance. Instead, communitarians believe that political and social community is morally relevant.
- Libertarian philosophy is best exemplified in the work of Robert Nozick, Anarchy, State and Utopia (1974). It has been influential among a number of development theorists in the formulation of what is now known as neoliberalism./n
## Right to development
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has promoted a “right to development”
- Much of the actual practice of Western aid allocation seems to imply a far less consistent view of the moral obligation to address global poverty
	- Development ethics suggests a kind of permanent, ongoing self-critique and evaluation of one’s actions and their effects
	- taking care to identify, privilege, and respect the rights of others over one’s more narrow professional objectives
- The concept of positionality suggests that researchers or development practitioners must be aware of the social and power relationships in which they are embedded
	- Lifestyle, dress, and behaviour abroad are important to local perceptions
- In general, development workers are expected to live modestly with the people they are supposed to assist
- Professionalism and advanced technical capacity should go hand in hand with high moral and ethical standards based on transparency and democratic accountability/n
### Development as a contested concept

> [!abstract]
> The concept of development is a subject of debate because there is no one clear definition of what development means. 
- "Development" is a contested concept with various definitions and implications
- The term has evolved over time, and is now used to refer to the Sustainable Development Goals
- Growth, inequality, and absolute and moderate poverty are important factors in development
- The capability approach and the human rights-based approach are two multi-dimensional approaches to development
- Development ethics and the need for self-reflection are important considerations in the field of international development
## Inequality and measuring development
- Inequality is the crucial link between GDP per capita and the number of people living in poverty because it affects how resources are distributed within a country. 
- GDP is an inadequate measure of development because it does not take into account factors such as the distribution of wealth, environmental sustainability, and social progress. 
- A multi-dimensional approach to development takes into account a variety of factors beyond GDP in order to more accurately measure a country's development. 
- The SDGs are an improvement on past approaches to development because they are more comprehensive and inclusive, considering a wider range of factors./n
