# Capability, Capacity, Maturity
| Capability                           | Capacity                                                                                                              | Maturity                                                                                                                  |

| The power or ability to do something | The resources available to do something:<br/>- Time is available <br/>- Effort can be applied<br/>- Team is available | A well-run organisation will be **capable** to perform its services and its processes will be reproducible (i.e. mature). |

# Maturity Model
> [!abstract] **A maturity model:**
> 
> -   Is a **tool** that helps people assess the current effectiveness of a person or group.
> -   Is structured as a **series of levels** of effectiveness.
> 
## Working with a maturity model
-   Begins with **assessment** - determine which level is currently performed. 
-   Use the **next level** to prioritize what capabilities are required next. 
-   **Decide** if the organisation would benefit from moving to the next level.

# CMMI
-   [[CMMI]] - Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) is:
-   A process **improvement** program to guide improvement across a project, division, or an entire organization.
-   Including **training and appraisal**
-   **Administered** by the CMMI Institute, a subsidiary of ISACA, it was developed at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). 
-   **Required** for many government contracts, especially in software development.

**Version 2.0 was published in 2018**, version 1.3 is still common
CMMI defines the following maturity levels for processes: 
0. Incomplete
1. Initial
2. Managed
3. Defined
4. Quantitatively Managed
5. Optimizing

# 4 stages of process discipline
1. Stage 1 - unconscious ad hoc and undisciplined.
2. Stage 2 - conscious realization that processes are ad hoc and unrecorded.
3. Stage 3 - record processes and establish mechanisms.
4. Stage 4 - processes and performance is clearly understood.

## Framework categories
The model is divided into 4 categories:
-   Doing
-   Managing
-   Enabling
-   Improving

# CMMI Appraisal
-   An organization (or project) is **appraised** in CMMI, not certified.
-   Can be awarded a **maturity level** rating (1-5) or a capability level achievement profile.
-   Appraisals are typically conducted for one or more of the following reasons:
	-   To determine **how well** the organizationâ€™s processes compare to CMMI models, for example having a Change Advisory Board (CAB) 
	-   To identify areas where **improvement** can be made
	-   To **inform** external customers and suppliers of how well the organizationâ€™s processes compare to CMMI best practices
-   To meet the **contractual** requirements of one or more customers

# Security
To address user security concerns, two security guides are available:
1.  **Considering the Case for Security Content in CMMI for Services** has one process area, Security Management.
2.  **Security by Design with CMMI for Development**, Version 1.3 has the following process areas:
	-   OPSD - Organizational Preparedness for Secure Development
	-   SMP - Secure Management in Projects
	-   SRTS - Security Requirements and Technical Solution
	-   SVV - Security Verification and Validation  
**While they do not affect maturity or capability levels, these process areas can be reported in appraisal result**
