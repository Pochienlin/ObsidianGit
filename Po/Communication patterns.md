## Communication
As defined by Cambridge Dictionary, communication is:
- the process of sharing information, especially when this increases understanding between people or groups:
	- Transfer and exchange information
	- Collaborate
	- Between enterprises, enterprise applications, software, (micro)services, etc.

 [[Enterprise Applications]] often need to use each other's functions or services, and exchange data, in order to realize business processes, within and between enterprises
```ad-note
title: A note on "processes" in the software context
Notes about the term "process":
- "processes" here refer to software processes running on a platform, not business processes. E.g., you can see the processes on Windows by using "Task Manager". 
- However, software processes can be used to implement business processes. (Software) processes usually refer to the dynamic, runtime instances of a software application; the same software application can have multiple processes (instances) running at the same time.

Enterprise applications often need to use each other's functions or services, and exchange data, in order to realize business processes, within and between enterprises

- Each microservice often implementsÂ functions for oneÂ entity only
	- Example entities: customer, account, product, order, payment, etc.
- Microservices can be **deployed separately** to **different machines**
- Each run of a microservice is a separate process in the OS in a machine
- Implementing a business process may require collaboration among more microservices than monolithic applications
- More communication among microservices across networks may be needed
- A **status change in a microservice may induce changes in other microservices**, triggering communications
- User interfaces need communications with underlying microservices
