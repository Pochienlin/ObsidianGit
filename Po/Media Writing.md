### Going deeper into what is good media writing
> [!question]
> How do you organise text to make it comprehensible, engaging... etc?
- Clear in meaning
- Simple and easy to understand
	- Readers should not need to re-read something just to understand it
- Concise and not wordy 
	- Can the same thing be said with fweer words?
- Precise words
	- Can the wording be misunderstood or misinterpreted?
	- Simple wordings are harder to misconstrue.
- Emphasize content over style

#### Example: What is wrong with this headline?
> [!note]
> Collaborative sharing fosters higher-level analytical skills through critical in-class discussions
- `Collaborative` and `sharing`: repetitive
- `Higher-leve`l: lacking a benchmark
- Passive voice
> [!tip]
> Discussions in class encourages analytical thinking
