**Bosingak** is a large [bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_(instrument) "Bell (instrument)") [pavilion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavilion "Pavilion") on [Jongno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jongno "Jongno") in [Seoul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul "Seoul"), [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea "South Korea"). The bell in Bosingak gives Jongno its name, which literally means "bell street". It was originally constructed in 1396 but destroyed many times by both war and fire. It was designated Bosingak by Emperor [Gojong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gojong_of_the_Korean_Empire "Gojong of the Korean Empire") in 1895.

In the [Joseon Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseon_Dynasty "Joseon Dynasty"), this bell was at the center of the castle town. The bell was struck to announce the opening and closing of the four gates around Seoul. At 4 am and 10 pm the bell was struck 33 times and gates were opened and closed. It was used as a fire alarm as well.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosingak#cite_note-1) In modern times, the bell is rung only at midnight on [New Year's Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year%27s_Eve "New Year's Eve"). Because of the massive number of people who attend this ceremony, Metro trains on [Line 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul_Subway_Line_1 "Seoul Subway Line 1") of the [Seoul Subway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul_Metropolitan_Subway "Seoul Metropolitan Subway") do not stop at [Jonggak Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonggak_Station "Jonggak Station") on New Year's Eve.

## History

It was in 1398 (the 7th year of King [Taejo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taejo_of_Joseon "Taejo of Joseon")'s reign) that the bell was first hung in [Hanyang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanyang_(Korea) "Hanyang (Korea)") during the Joseon Dynasty, and a bell that was cast in [Gwangju](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwangju "Gwangju") was hung on the west side of [Cheongungyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cheongungyo&action=edit&redlink=1 "Cheongungyo (page does not exist)")'s bell tower.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosingak#cite_note-2)
