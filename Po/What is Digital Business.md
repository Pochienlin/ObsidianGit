Case studies: 
1. [[Swee Choon Dim Sum]]
2. [[Chien Chi Tow]]
The commonality between Chien Chi Tow and Swee Choon:
- There is untapped revenue potential because certain viable customer groups cannot reach the product
- Attempt to survive in tightened demands
	- Swee Choon: COVID-19's hit on F&B
	- CCT: consumer behaviour of younger consumers
- Limitations:
	- Space for Swee Choon: 
		- Limited dine-in spaces, especially during COVID-19. 
		- Limited walking space also slows service staff down

## Overview
> [!abstract]
> “Digital businesses use technology to create new value in business models, customer experiences and the internal capabilities that support its core operations. The term includes both digital-only brands and traditional players that are transforming their businesses with digital technologies.”
## General unviability of traditional models
85% of businesses recognise a need to move into digital businesses, while 4% have already made fundamental changes. 11% will not survive without transformation (McKinsey survey)

### Digital Business may not always mean e-business
“Digital businesses use technology to create **new value** in business models, customer experiences and the internal capabilities that support its core operations. 
- The term includes **both digital-only brands and traditional players that are transforming their businesses with digital technologies.**”

## Differentiating Digitization, Digitalization and Digital Transformation
1. Digitzalization progresses from Digitization to move beyond changing the form to changing and add to processes
2. Digital transformation progresses from digitalization by transforming operating models, strategy and value propositions

| Change a paper checklist into an App checklist                                   | Digitization*  |
| Convert the attendance-taking process into a smartcard tapping process               | Digitization*  |
| Transform payment processes so that data can be collected in real-time and analyzed | Digitalization |

> [!example] E.g. Tekka Fish market:
> 1. Merchants aggregated on Facebook Marketplace but is unable to fulfil the boom in orders 
> 2. The backend remained the same, and was unable to handle payments and order tracking online
> 3. This remains at Digitization of the storefront, but cannot constitute transforming institutional operations, as such it is not an example of digitalization

## Digital leadership: Pierre Nanterme of Accenture
The labour arbitrage will eventually closed, at which point, what drives your growth? It is digital transformation and increased productivity and sales through technology. This is enabled by being selective in the investments made, the kind of technology that are (1) applicable here and now, and are (2) proven technologies, or thoughtful technologies mature enough to drive the benefits. This also requires strong and acccurate metrics that can help with aligning (1) people, (2) business goals, and (3) investments.
- Communication is helpful for alignment towards the common goal
- Measurements are important for a closed-loop feedback that justifies investments with returns
- Technologies must be selective, thoughtful; Mature technologies that fit the use case is necessary
- Investment is into high-growth, high-value areas

## Transformation is total, not partial
> [!quote]
> Digital is not just an API
#### Culture, not tech, is the key to digital transformation
| Impact                                                 | Speed                                                                           | Openness                                                                                                                                     | Autonomy                                                                                                                                |

| Change the world radically through constant innovation | Move fast and iterate rather than waiting to have all the answers before acting | Engage broadly with diverse sources of information and insight. Share advice and information openly rather than keeping knowledge to oneself | Allow people high levels of discretion to do what needs to be done rather than relying on formally structured coordination and policies |
#### Tools to use
- Agile methodology
- [[Design thinking]] process
	- Rapid prototyping

## Business Ecosystem
> [!question]
> Is the customer everything?
Ecosystem involved:
1. Regulators/ State
2. Infrastructure
3. Supporting industries
4. Software giants
5. Mindsets

## Technology needs assessment
1. Gather relevant information
	- Audit infrastructure, processes and systems
	- Study workflow and conduct surveys and interviews
2. Identify drivers for change

## Using analytics and digital leadership
Continual improvement is made availble 
1. Higher number of digital transaction
	1. Data for customer and employees help improvements and making of decisions
2. Digital platform: Repository of business, data and infrastructural components to rapidly configure digital offering
	1. Measurement to support continual improvement

Example from the case studies:
1. [[Swee Choon Dim Sum]] used heatmaps to decide on their next store location
2. [[Chien Chi Tow]] used analytics and user stories to target a new audience group and decide on their new brand image
	- Yen's leadership to unite business and IT was the missing piece, beyond engaging IT and design partners
	- This is required to get buy-in from her staff

1. What are 3 common elements of Digital Businesses?
	1. **Use existing technologies to cut costs, gather data and provide a better customer experience.** 
		1. Digital businesses focus on the competitive advantages that technology gains them, whether that’s reducing overhead or providing new value to their customers.
	2. Embrace the **digital transformation concept and the required cultural shifts**.
		1. The implementation and management of digital services can necessitate organizational restructuring, and especially as new roles are created and IT is given greater input into strategic decisions.
	 1. Explore **new business models that put customer experience at the centre of digital strategy**. 
		 1. People are often willing to spend more for an exceptional customer experience, making it a key differentiator in the digital economy. Business models that align with this hyper-focus on customer satisfaction will eventually centre on digital services since digital is increasingly the experience that people prefer.
2. Discuss the following statement:
> [!quote]
> Digital business is changing the way organizations use and think about technology, moving technology from a supporting player to a leading player in innovation, revenue and market growth
Companies still need unique selling points and good strategies: technology may secure first-mover advantages, but cannot maintain them (e.g. Netflix). A sustainable business needs good, unique products and services with a stable customer base.
1. How is digital business distinct from e-business?
	1. E-business is a matter of efficiency, automating and optimizing processes
	2. Digital Business provides value chains based on technology
2. How did Netflix switch from e-business to digital business?
	1. Before that they were an e-business, using a digital inventory-keeping system for their mail service
	2. Use technology to stream video on demand
	3. Change business model to subscription of digital products
	4. Use data to improve customer experience
> [!tip] summary
> Netflix began as a DVD rental-by-mail service, but as streaming technology improved, it shifted its business model to streaming movies and television shows online, giving customers a new and more convenient way to watch their favourite content. They also used data mining to give better suggestions for viewership

3. Why is Disney’s MagicBand used as an example of digital business?
	1. Brought convenience by gathering data from customers to save time queuing and parking, at the same time lowering the variable cost to manage crowd
	2. In doing so they create a new form of experience for the customers
> [!tip] summary
> it is a wearable device that allows Disney World visitors to access the park, pay for food and merchandise, and access FastPass+ reservations. It exemplifies how technology can be used to create new value and experiences that differentiate companies, by providing customers a seamless and convenient way to access park and enhancing their overall experience.
