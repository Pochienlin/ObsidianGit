# Overview
> [!abstract] Summary
> In _The Republic_, Plato defines his idea that there is a **tripartite** soul. In other words, each person's soul is divided into three different parts, and these parts are simply in different balance from one person to the next.
> 
> Plato defines the soul's three parts as the logical part, the spirited part, and the appetitive part.
- Tripartite human pysche: reason, passion, desire
        - Reason: intellect, contemplation, reflection, wisdom
        - Passion: courage, bravery, resolve
    - Morality: harmonious ordering of the parts
        - not just about rules or norms of right and wrong at a given specific place in a given specific situation.
        - foundational concept that ought to apply universally, and across all situations, across all phenomena
        - doesn't have a substance
            - formal term: harmonious order
    - Hierarchy: the rule of reason
        - Tripartite are not of equal value
            - when the part which is naturally better is in control of the worst part, then we use this phrase self mastery.
            - harmonious ordering between the parts is inescapably a hierarchical ordering
        - desires, appetites needs are endless. They don't have a form. They don't have a direction, that chaotic.
        - faculty of reason is what enables order is what enables measure and moderation.
        - faculty of reason is what enables order is what enables measure and moderation.
# The soul
> [!quote] from The Republic
> Is there any function of the soul that you could not accomplish with anything else, such as taking care of something (_epimeleisthai_), ruling, and deliberating, and other such things? Could we correctly assign these things to anything besides the soul, and say that they are characteristic (_idia_) of it?
> 
> No, to nothing else.

> What about living? Will we deny that this is a function of the soul?
> 
> That absolutely is.

Plato was the first person in the history of philosophy to believe that the soul was both the source of life and the mind. In Plato's dialogues, we find the soul playing many disparate roles. Among other things, Plato believes that the soul is what gives life to the body (which was articulated most of all in the _Laws_ and _Phaedrus_) in terms of self-motion: to be alive is to be capable of moving yourself; the soul is a self-mover. He also thinks that the soul is the bearer of moral properties (i.e., when I am virtuous, it is my soul that is virtuous as opposed to, say, my body). The soul is also the mind: it is that which thinks in us.
# Tripartite soul
The Platonic soul consists of three parts which are located in different regions of the body:
1.  the logos (λογιστικόν), or _logistikon_, located in the head, is related to reason and regulates the other parts.
2.  the thymos (θυμοειδές), or _thumoeides_, located near the chest region, is related to spirit.
3.  the eros (ἐπιθυμητικόν), or _epithumetikon_, located in the stomach, is related to one's desires.

In his treatise the Republic, and also with the chariot allegory in Phaedrus, Plato asserted that the three parts of the _psyche_ also correspond to the three classes of a society (_viz._ the rulers, the military, and the ordinary citizens) The function of the _epithymetikon_ is to produce and seek pleasure. The function of the _logistikon_ is to gently rule through the love of learning. The function of the _thymoeides_ is to obey the directions of the _logistikon_ while ferociously defending the whole from external invasion and internal disorder.

Whether in a city or an individual, justice (δικαιοσύνη, _dikaiosyne_) is declared to be the state of the whole in which each part fulfills its function, while temperance is the state of the whole where each part does not attempt to interfere in the functions of the others. Injustice (ἀδικία, _adikia_) is the contrary state of the whole, often taking the specific form in which the spirited is obedient to the appetitive, while they together either ignore the logical entirely or employ it in their pursuits of pleasure.

# In The Republic
In Book IV, part 5, of the Republic, Socrates and his interlocutors (Glaucon and Adeimantus) are attempting to answer whether the soul is one or made of parts. Socrates states: "It is obvious that the same thing will never do or suffer opposites in the same respect in relation to the same thing and at the same time. So that if ever we find these contradictions in the functions of the mind we shall know that it was not the same thing functioning but a plurality." (This is an example of Plato's principle of non-contradiction.) For instance, it seems that, given each person has only one soul, it should be impossible for a person to simultaneously desire something yet also at that very moment be averse to the same thing, as when one is tempted to commit a crime but also averse to it. Both Socrates and Glaucon agree that it should not be possible for the soul to be at the same time both in one state and its opposite. From this it follows that there must be at least two aspects to soul. Having named these as "reason" and "appetite", Plato goes on to identify a third aspect, "spirit", which in a healthy psyche ought to be aligned with reason.

### Reason (λογιστικόν)
See also: Heraclitus § Logos
The logical or logistikon (from logos) is the thinking part of the soul which loves the truth and seeks to learn it. Plato originally identifies the soul dominated by this part with the Athenian temperament.

Plato makes the point that the logistikon would be the smallest part of the soul (as the rulers would be the smallest population within the Republic), but that, nevertheless, a soul can be declared just only if all three parts agree that the logistikon should rule.

### Spirit (θυμοειδές)
According to Plato, the spirited or thymoeides (from thymos) is the part of the soul by which we are angry or get into a temper.[15] He also calls this part 'high spirit' and initially identifies the soul dominated by this part with the Thracians, Scythians and the people of "northern regions".

### Appetite (ἐπιθυμητικόν)
The appetite or epithymetikon (from epithymia, translated to Latin as concupiscentia or desiderium).
