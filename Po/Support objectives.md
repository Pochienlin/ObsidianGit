## What are the objectives to a support team?
Companies need reliable enterprise solutions.

Good support provides this by having:

- [[Service level agreements]] e.g. availability
- An understanding of what is a solution, e.g. system components
- Knowing the stakeholders - who is involved in a system
- Business critical needs:
    - When are important times for the solution to be available
    - Usage
    - Regulations
- Appropriate deployment models e.g. cloud usage
