**HTML:** Content, *nouns*

**CSS**: Presentation, *adjectives* 

**Javascript**: Dynamic effects, *verbs*

By using CSS, we separate the content of a web page from the presentation (format & styling) of that content.

CSS enables us to make all pages of our website look similar and consistent.

CSS allows us to make site-wide formatting changes by making edits to a single file.
