# Locke’s times and context

Seventeenth-century English Enlightenment

- Empiricism: sense experience, tabula rasa
- Natural history: Baconianism, useful knowledge
- Natural jurisprudence: rights and obligations under natural law
- Religious toleration: civil vs. ecclesiastical domains

Seventeenth-century social, economic, political transformations

- Liberalism, capitalism, Protestantism
- Individualism, limited government
- Bourgeois private property and capital accumulation

Restoration of the monarchy (1660), Exclusion Crisis (1679-81), Glorious Revolution (1688)

- The household of Shaftesbury: involvement in the Whig political cause
- Board of Trade: administrative role in English colonialism
- Reformation, Anglican Church, Religious Wars (e.g. 30 Years’ War) and Dissenters in England: religious toleration

Two Treatises of Government

1. First Treatise: repudiation of absolutist prerogative (Robert Filmer’s Patriarcha)
2.  Second Treatise: theory of limited government and popular sovereignty
- A Letter Concerning Toleration: bounds of civil and spiritual authority

# Natural rights and Law

> “But though this be a state of liberty, yet it is not a state of licence … The state of nature has a law of nature to govern it, which obliges every one: and reason, which is that law, teaches all mankind, who will but consult it, that being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions”
> 

State of nature: natural rights, liberty, and equality

- Individualism: both methodological and moral
- Natural equality: absence of jurisdiction over others
- Natural liberty: freedom to direct one’s person and possessions
- Liberty ≠ “licence” – ”natural law”

- Natural law: external, transcendental moral standard
    - Discoverable by reason
    - Universally binding
- Reason: prudential and moral faculty; innate and universal
- Enforcement: universal right to punish transgressors
- State of nature ≠ state of war

> “And here we have the plain difference between the state of nature and the state of war, which however some men have confounded … Men living together according to reason, without a common superior on earth, with authority to judge between them, is properly the state of nature.”
> 

# Labour theory of property

Unilateral, non-consensual origins of

- Property natural (pre-political) and private (individual, exclusive)
- Self-ownership; possessive individualism

Labor as personal property; mixing labor with the natural common

- Property in land: cultivation, plantation, “subduing,” “improvement”
- Morality of property (not mere expediency); the “industrious and rational”
- Private property: natural, prepolitical
- Labor theory of value: combining legal and economic argument
    - Spontaneous nature vs. products of labor
    - “Common stock of mankind”: universal benefits of private property
    - Historical progress: America (state of nature) vs. England (civilization)

Limits to appropriation: labor (improvement) and use (spoilage)

- Natural limits to appropriation: relative equality of property
- Invention of money: circumvention of natural limits
- Unleashing labor: accumulation and inequality of wealth
- Consent to money = consent to inequality

”Inconveniences” of the state of nature

- Monetization and commodification (exchange values) = inequality and abstraction of property
- Individual self-regard, partiality, and dispute between property owners
- Conflict and insecurity
- Need for laws, judges, and enforcers

> “the enjoyment of the property he has in this state is very unsafe, very insecure. This makes him willing to quit this condition … to join in society with others … for the mutual preservation of their lives, liberties, and estates, which I call by the general name, property … The great and chief end, therefore, of men’s uniting into commonwealths and putting themselves under government, is the preservation of their property.”
> 

# Social contract and civil government

Why government?

- Hobbes: Government as the basis of property rights
- Locke: Origins in labour

> This makes him willing to quit this condition … to join in society with others … for the mutual preservation of their lives, liberties, and estates, which I call by the general name, property … The great and chief end, therefore, of men’s uniting into commonwealths and putting themselves under government, is the preservation of their property.”
> 

Legislation (laws), adjudication (judges), execution (magistrates)

- Individual consent: delegating the right to execute natural law
- Impartial judges; civil laws; civil liberties
- Laws as hedges/fences (recall the political problem of liberalism)

> “…and that ill deserves the name of confinement which hedges us in only from bogs and precipices. So that, however it may be mistaken, the end of law is not to abolish or restrain, but to preserve and enlarge freedom: for in all the states of created beings capable of laws, where there is no law, there is no freedom: for liberty is, to be free from restraint and violence from others”
> 

Ends of government: security, peace, enjoyment of property

- Negative liberty: freedom from encroachment
- Ends of government = limits of government
- Demystification of the state: referee, umpire, night watchman (cf. Hobbes)

> “the power of the society, or legislative constituted by them, can never be supposed to extend farther, than the common good; but is obliged to secure every one’s property, by providing against those three defects above mentioned that made the state of nature so unsafe and uneasy”
> 

Limited / representative government:

- Rule of law vs. arbitrary power; subjection of rulers to laws (cf. Hobbes)
- Pre-political rights as checks on arbitrary power
- Natural law and consent: outer and inner limits of public authority
- Taxation without consent = confiscation, breach of “trust”

> “…as if when men quitting the state of nature entered into society, they agreed that all of them but one, should be under the restraint of laws, but that he should still retain all the liberty of the state of nature, increased with power, and made licentious by impunity. This is to think, that men are so foolish, that they take care to avoid what mischiefs may be done them by pole-cats, or foxes; but are content, nay, think it safety, to be devoured by lions.”
> 

> “If any one shall claim a power to lay and levy taxes on the people, by his own authority, and without such consent of the people, he thereby invades the fundamental law of property, and subverts the end of government”
> 

Right to rebellion: state of war resumed (*rebellare*)

- Corruption of political power; violation of mandate; loss of legitimacy (authority vs. force)
- No common judge over the rulers and the ruled: “appeal to heaven”
- Retraction of consent; dissolution of constituted power
- Revolution of constituent power to the “people”

# Religious toleration

Boundaries of church and state; sin and crime

- Salvation of souls vs. “civil interest” (life, liberty, estate)
- Belief vs. laws; persuasion vs. compulsion
- Churches and commonwealths “voluntary” bodies: consent

“Duty of toleration”: equality before the law; liberty of conscience

- Firewall between religious and civil obligations
- Exceptions to toleration:
- “Papists”: undermining sovereign unity and territoriality
- Atheists: undermining covenants and trust
- Demobilizing religion in politics for peace

Primacy of the individual, subjective rights and liberties

- Laws regulating interaction between individuals
- Government as artificial construct for dispute resolution
- Material ends of government (“mere life”): peace, security, property
- Political power limited by its functions

# Political and economic liberalism

Property-constituting, value-creating powers of labor

- Economic sterility of political power
- State/society distinction; primacy of the social; economic interdependence prior to sovereign power
- Private enterprise; market coordination; trickle-down
- Minimal, if indispensable, role of government: property, contracts, defense
