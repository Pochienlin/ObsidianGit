## Overview
> [!abstract] Summary
> There are two main schools of thought on how to approach underdevelopment: there is the _Modernisation Theory_ and there is the _Dependency Theory_. Usually they are taken as diametrically opposed views

## Modernisation Theory
> [!question]
> Why are some countries demonstrably wealthier than others? Why do some countries suffer from extreme poverty and others do not?
### Origins
The "classical" theories of modernization of the 1950s and 1960s drew on sociological analyses of Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim and a partial reading of Max Weber, and were strongly influenced by the writings of Harvard sociologist Talcott Parsons. Modernization theory was a dominant paradigm in the social sciences in the 1950s and 1960s, then went into a deep eclipse. It made a comeback after 1991, when Francis Fukuyama wrote about the end of the Cold War as confirmation on modernization theory and more generally of universal history. But the theory remains a controversial model.

### What is modernisation?
Modernization refers to a model of a progressive transition from a "pre-modern" or "traditional" to a "modern" society. Modernization theory suggests that traditional societies will develop as they adopt more modern practices. Proponents of modernization theory claim that modern states are wealthier and more powerful and that their citizens are freer to enjoy a higher standard of living. 

Developments such as new data technology and the need to update traditional methods in transport, communication and production make modernization necessary or at least preferable to the status quo. That view makes critique difficult since it implies that such developments control the limits of human interaction, not vice versa. 

And yet, seemingly paradoxically, it also implies that human agency controls the speed and severity of modernization. Supposedly, instead of being dominated by tradition, societies undergoing the process of modernization typically arrive at forms of governance dictated by abstract principles. Traditional religious beliefs and cultural traits, according to the theory, usually become less important as modernization takes hold.

### Democracy and modernisation: Linked or forced?
The relationship between modernization and democracy or democratization is one of the most researched studies in comparative politics. There are many studies show that modernization has contributed to democracy in some countries. For example, Seymour Martin Lipset argued that modernization can turn into democracy." There is academic debate over the drivers of democracy because there are theories that support economic growth as both a cause and effect of the institution of democracy. ‚ÄúLipset‚Äôs observation that democracy is related to economic development, first advanced in 1959, has generated the largest body of research on any topic in comparative politics,‚Äù

#### Critiques
##### Asian Tigers as an exception to the rule
Randall Peerenboom explores the relationships among democracy, the rule of law and their relationship to wealth by pointing to examples of Asian countries, such as Taiwan and South Korea, which have successfully democratized only after economic growth reached relatively high levels and to examples of countries such as the Philippines, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Thailand, Indonesia and India, which sought to democratize at lower levels of wealth but have not done as well.

##### Transition analysis
Adam Przeworski and others have challenged Lipset's argument. They say political regimes do not transition to democracy as per capita incomes rise. Rather, democratic transitions occur randomly, but once there, countries with higher levels of gross domestic product per capita remain democratic. Epstein et al. (2006) retest the modernization hypothesis using new data, new techniques, and a three-way, rather than dichotomous, classification of regimes. Contrary to Przeworski, this study finds that the modernization hypothesis stands up well. Partial democracies emerge as among the most important and least understood regime types.

##### Correlational studies
Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson, in their article "Income and Democracy" (2008) further weaken the case for Lipset's argument by showing that even though there is a strong cross-country correlation between income and democracy, once one controls for country fixed effects and removes the association between income per capita and various measures of democracy, there is "no causal effect of income on democracy." In "Non-Modernization" (2022), they further argue that modernization theory cannot account for various paths of political development "because it posits a link between economics and politics that is not conditional on institutions and culture and that presumes a definite endpoint‚Äîfor example, an 'end of history'."

## Dependency Theory 
DT uses the core-periphery model and asserts that resources flow from a "periphery" of poor and underdeveloped states to a "core" of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the "world system". 

This theory was officially developed in the late 1960s following World War II, as scholars searched for the root issue in the lack of development in Latin America.

### Reaction to modernisation theory
The theory arose as a reaction to modernization theory, an earlier theory of development which held that all societies progress through similar stages of development, that today's underdeveloped areas are thus in a similar situation to that of today's developed areas at some time in the past, and that, therefore, the task of helping the underdeveloped areas out of poverty is to accelerate them along this supposed common path of development, by various means such as investment, technology transfers, and closer integration into the world market. Dependency theory rejected this view, arguing that underdeveloped countries are not merely primitive versions of developed countries, but have unique features and structures of their own; and, importantly, are in the situation of being the weaker members in a world market economy.

## Characteristics
### Colonisation
- Most underdeveloped countries tend to be former colonies while most developed countries are colonisers
- We can roughly divide these countries' histories into
	- Pre-colonial
	- Colonial
	- Post-colonial

## Path dependence
[[Path dependence]] is the dependence of economic outcomes on the path of previous outcomes, rather than simply on current conditions. In a path dependent process, ‚Äúhistory matters‚Äù ‚Äî it has an enduring influence. Choices made on the basis of transitory conditions can persist long after those conditions change.

Thus, explanations of the outcomes of path-dependent processes require looking at history, rather than simply at current conditions of technology, preferences, and other factors that determine outcomes.

Path-dependent features of the economy range from small-scale technical standards to large-scale institutions and patterns of economic development. Several of the most prominent path-dependent features of the economy are technical standards, such as the ‚ÄúQWERTY‚Äù standard typewriter (and computer) keyboard and the ‚Äústandard gauge‚Äù of railway track ‚Äî i.e., the width between the rails. The case of QWERTY has been particularly controversial, and it is discussed at some length below. The case of track gauge is useful for introducing several typical features of path-dependent processes and their outcomes.
