Tourism can often bring economic benefits to a destination, but it can also create social issues for the local community. Some of the social issues that tourism can cause include:

1. Overcrowding and pressure on resources: 
	1. Tourism can lead to overcrowding in a destination, which can put pressure on local resources such as housing, water, and infrastructure. 
	2. This can lead to rising prices and difficulty accessing these resources for local residents.
2. Displacement of local residents: 
	1. In some cases, tourism development can lead to the displacement of local residents, as property values and rents rise in response to the influx of tourists. 
	2. This can result in long-term residents being forced to leave their homes and communities. 
3. Changes to the local culture: 
	1. Tourism can also lead to changes in the local culture, as new businesses and development projects catering to tourists may alter the character and traditions of the community. 
	2. This can lead to a loss of cultural identity and a sense of disconnection among local residents.
## Case studies:

1. Bali, Indonesia: 
	- Bali is a popular tourist destination known for its beautiful beaches and cultural attractions. 
	- However, the rapid growth of the tourism industry has put pressure on the island's resources and led to environmental degradation, overcrowding, and rising property prices. 
	- Local residents have also reported feeling a loss of control over the direction of the island's development and a loss of cultural identity.
2. Venice, Italy: 
	- Venice is a city with a rich cultural heritage and a popular tourist destination. 
	- However, the city has faced challenges related to overtourism, with local residents reporting overcrowding, rising rents, and difficulty accessing resources. 
	- The city has implemented measures to try to address these issues, including limiting the number of visitors and promoting alternative forms of tourism.
3. Dubrovnik, Croatia: 
	1. Dubrovnik is a city with a rich cultural and historical heritage that has become a popular tourist destination in recent years. 
	2. However, the rapid growth of the tourism industry has led to overcrowding, environmental degradation, and rising prices, which have affected the local community. 
	3. The city has implemented measures to try to address these issues, including limiting the number of visitors and promoting sustainable tourism practices.

## Creating better incentives
Sometimes, tourism presents a new revenue stream for the country and allows it to shift away from problematic sectors, or reduce reliance on such sectors.

One of such uses of tourism is [[Suriname]], which registered its expansive rainforests for conservation status. Through the Suriname Conservation Foundation, the country developed ecotourism as a new source of income, diversifying their economy.

Prior to this, the economy is hugely reliant on the exporting of natural resources, particularly Bauxite and Gold, during their Dutch colonial period.
