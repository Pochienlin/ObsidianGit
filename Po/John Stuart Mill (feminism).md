# Overview

<aside>
üí° 1st wave feminists pushed the logical conclusion of feminism to its obvious extension: the emancipation and equality for women

</aside>

- Politically charged terms in circulation in trend with the Enlightenment is used as the medium to conceive of gender as a relationship of power
- It is recognised as arbitrary, irrational and oppressive ‚Üí abolishing of legal privilege is about equality, not sameness (none in the 1st wave demanded for the private/public divide or division of labour, that matter would be taken up in the second and third wave)

- Universalism and gender
- Background to late-18th century feminism
- Gender inequality as oppression
- Rationality and rights
- Education and socialization
- Citizenship and democracy
- Feminism after the founders

# Universalism and gender

Paradox of ‚Äúexclusionary universals‚Äù: universal claims, practical exclusions (race, class, gender)

- E.g. ‚ÄúMan is the political animal‚Äù (except slaves, women, children, barbarians, mechanics, and aliens)
- Universality of message based on the politically relevant universe: ‚Äúwho counts?‚Äù
- Community of equal, independent, right-bearing subjects

Gender as the oldest & most persistent principle of exclusion

- Gendered binaries of Western political thought; natural hierarchies
- Man/women: higher/lower; soul/body, active/passive, stable/fickle, intellect/nature, man/beast, day/night, sun/moon, strong/weak, public/private
- E.g. Ancient Greeks: natural subjection of the irrational part (passion and appetite) to the rational part (self-discipline)
- Western mythologies: Pandora‚Äôs box, fall from Heaven

# First wave feminism and its contexts

Industrial Revolution, market economy: divide between workplace (productive) and home (reproductive)

- Intensified sexual division of labor; confinement of women to the household; devaluation of domestic labor
- Sharper disparities of power, independence, control

‚ÄúAge of Enlightenment/Revolutions‚Äù: demolishing dogma and traditional hierarchy

- Exclusion of women and slaves from the promise of Enlightenment
- Ideological resources for internal critique: taking Enlightenment to task

# Gender inequality as oppression

Political language: gender as a relationship of power

- Natural differences translated into social, political, legal, economic privilege (cf. Rousseau)
- Exclusion from the public institutions of power and denial of independent legal personality
- Demand for rights: civil (property, contract, employment) and political (vote, office, participation)

‚ÄúLiberal‚Äù feminism: unaccountable, arbitrary power = ‚Äútyranny,‚Äù ‚Äúdespotism‚Äù

- Non-consensual subjection women = ‚Äúslavery‚Äù
- Gender inequality as a political (vs. private) problem; a matter of justice

# Rationality and rights

Enlightenment liberalism: reason as the foundation of freedom (cf. Locke, Rousseau, Kant)

- Claim to natural equality of reason with men ‚Üí claim to the same inalienable natural rights
- Legal equality, equality of talents and abilities, equality of opportunity
- ‚ÄúLiberal‚Äù feminism: rights, contracts, jurisprudence

# Education and socialisation

‚ÄúFeminine‚Äù behavior: not nature but nurture; socialization, discipline, indoctrination

- Gender as a social construct: mistaking the effect for the cause
- Public reform: extension of civil and political rights
- Educational reform: same education for men & women
- Emancipation of women: cultivation of masculine traits

# Citizenship and democracy

Pushing the demand for equality beyond civil rights

- Right to vote, to hold office, to free speech
    - De Gouges: ‚Äúright to mount the scaffold‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúright to mount the speaker‚Äôs platform‚Äù
- Rousseauvian democratic (though not necessarily republican) principles

# Feminism after its founders

First wave feminism (19th century):

- Enlightenment ideology, universal rights, natural equality
- Equality of reason, equality of rights, equality before the law
- Denaturing gender: education and socialization make women feminine
- Claims to legal personality, independence, public inclusion
- Civil and political rights, representative government

Second-wave feminism (1960s-1980s)

- From public to private spaces: the household, the workplace
- Gendered division of labor, domestic work, reproductive rights, domestic violence, gendered labor market and workplace

Third-wave feminism (1990s-present)

- Liberal feminism redux: equality of opportunity, competition
- Intersectionality: race and class; black, brown, and poor women
- Radical feminism: social construction of all gender norms and stereotypes; fluidity of gender and sexual categories

# Questions

1. Is it right to say that in Wollstonecraft's writings, she advocates not for equality of gender but equality of sexes?
    1. It appears she challenged not the role of women, but the presumptuous biological inferiority of women
    2. How else can one reconcile the view that women is simultaneously equal to men, but is assigned a portion lower than that of men?
2. What exactly was in Emile that so enraged Wollstonecraft into her impassioned writing?
3. How much did Mill's writings, or even those that precede him, influence Wollstonecraft?
4.
