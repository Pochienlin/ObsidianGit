## Natural resources as a way to reframe environment
The terms "natural resource" and "environment" points to the exact same physical entities. However, by framing it as "natural resources", governments and markets imply some natural right and permission to use it for their own gain
- extreme pollution
- little/no regulations
- international standards
	- UNFCCC
	- CBD
	- IPCC

## Race to the bottom in standards
- lower regulations $\implies$ investment
- FDI less inhibited with lower regulations
- Less regulated countries become dumping ground for waste
- Guiyu China, Lagos Nigeria, Agogbloshie Ghana became [[e-waste]] dumping grounds

### Sustainable development
Development that meets the needs of present without compromising future generation's ability to meet their own needsÂ 
- Is this practical?
- Example of [[Suriname]]: It comes at a cost, but can be rationally sensible
