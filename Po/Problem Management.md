# **Problem Management**
 ```ad-quote
title: defining problems in ITIL
Problem: A cause, or potential cause, of one or more incidents.
```

In ITIL 4, Service Management Practices ensure that services deliver agreed levels of availability to meet the needs of customers and users.
- *Event*  any change of state that has significance for the management of a service. Typically they are notifications from monitoring tools.
- *Incident* an unplanned interruption to a service or reduction in the quality of a service.
- *Problem* a cause, or potential cause, of one or more incidents
```ad-tip
ðŸ’¡ Week 5 focuses on **incidents**

- **Problems** will be covered this week
- For **events**, recall week 4 monitoring

# Problem Management Overview

> The purpose of problem management (PM) is to **reduce the likelihood and impact** of incidents by identifying actual and potential causes of incidents and managing workarounds and known errors.
> 
- **PM processes are both reactive and proactive:**
    - **Reactive** in solving problems in response to incidents,
    - **Proactive** in identifying and solving potential incidents before they occur.
```ad-note
ðŸ’¡ **Often seen as:**

- The **same incident** occurring many times
- An incident that **affects many users**
- Systems are **not operating** in the expected way
```

## Problem management phases
- Every service has errors, flaws or vulnerabilities that may cause incidents.
- Problem management involves three distinct phases:

|Area|Examples|Solutions|
|-----|-----|----|
|Infrastructure, Hardware| Out of memory <br>Disk Failure<br>Faulty network cables|Increase RAM <br> Replace|
|Software or IT Systems and Apps|Unexpected behaviour (bugs) <br>missing/wrong functionality|Patch the code|
|User People (Wetware)|Misusing the systems<br>Intentional attacks| User training<br>Improve the UI/UX|
|Data| Incorrect or missing|Update/clean the data|

# **Troubleshooting**
---
 [[Root cause analysis (RCA)]]

### Effective troubleshooting skills

1. Tech knowledge
2. Patience
3. Empathy
4. Incident process definition
5. Methodologies definition
6. Active listening
7. Questioning (see RCA below)
8. Analytical thinking
9. positive attitude - Growth mindset

#### 1. [[Timeline analysis]]
#### 2.  RCA - [[Ishikawa Fishbone Diagram]]

# Problem Response

After completing RCA, troubleshooting is completed by:

1. Design the solution based on all the analysis
2. Decide when implement the solution
3. Follow the [[Implementation â€“ Change process]] (Week 9)

## Find a workaround
- If a problem cannot be resolved quickly enough
- Document and implement
- Review and improve once problem analysis is complete

## Error control activities

The final phase in problem management is error control.

The activities include:

- Manage known errors such as faulty components
- Identify potential permanent solutions
- Regularly reassess the status of known errors not yet resolved.
