- **Contrasting:** Gandhi, British Empire, and non-violence
- Fanon, French Empire, and violence

# Race and the paradox of universalism

#### Race: delimiting the politically relevant universe (the community of equals)
- Racism: exclusion based on belief in the innate inferiority of a group
- Doctrines and attitudes; laws and policies; prejudices and practices
- Race as a social construct: arbitrary, circumstantial markers of difference

#### Racism as a system of power
- Material: distribution of resources and positions ‚Äì class (e.g. racialized labor)
- Legal: formal rights or their exercise ‚Äì citizenship (e.g. ‚Äúsecond-class citizens‚Äù)
- Symbolic: self-worth, dignity ‚Äì identity (e.g. ‚Äúseparate but equal‚Äù = unequal)

# Colonialism and Racism

Modern European colonialism (16th-20th century) and the birth of racism as a political language (18th-20th century)
- Construction of European ‚Äúwhiteness‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-whiteness‚Äù
- Hierarchical ordering of social difference: white, yellow, red, brown, black
- Military, political, economic dominance: race as a narrative of superiority
####  Racial binaries: 
- reason/passion, 
- virtue/effeminacy, 
- industry/sloth, 
- freedom/servility, 
- progress/stagnation‚Ä¶
#### Racism as imperial ideology: 
enslaving irrational blacks, expropriating savage Indians, dominating servile Asiatics
- Scientific racism: from monogenesis and differentiation to polygenesis and biological difference
##### Anti-colonialism and repudiation of racism
- Western civilization as barbarism: conquest, exploitation, corruption
- The colonized as the true bearers of universal ideals
- Claims to moral worth, dignity, equality, autonomy
- Violent and non-violent anti-colonialism: Fanon and [[Mohandas Gandhi]]

### The Algerian War, 1954-1962
Fanon on decolonization and racism:
- Dehumanizing violence of colonialism
- Regenerative violence of anti-colonial struggle
#### Colonial rule founded on violence = necessity of anti-colonial violence
- Occupation, pacification, expropriation, exploitation
- Manichean colonial ideology: civilized/barbarous, master/slave, white/black
- Bankruptcy of Enlightenment universals (liberty, equality, fraternity)
> [!tip] main point
> [[Mimetic isomorphism]] between colonizer & colonized; methods of colonization ‚Üí methods of decolonization
- Naivety/outrage of expecting the colonized to seek justice in the colonial system
- Anti-colonial violence: the colonized speaking back to the colonizer (‚Äúthe colonizer understands nothing but force)

#### Positive/constructive effects of violence
- Politicization and social integration of the colonized; recovery of a purpose and belonging
- Overcoming inferiority; recovering dignity, self-respect
- Political unity (vs. colonial strategy of divide-and-rule); common cause, ‚Äúnational front‚Äù
- Political ownership of the independent polity
