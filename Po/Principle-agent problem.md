> The principalâ€“agent problem refers to the conflict in interests and priorities that arises when one person or entity (the "agent") take actions on behalf of another person or entity (the "principal"). The problem worsens in situations when there is a greater discrepancy of interests and information asymmetry between the principal and agent, as well as when the principal lacks the means to punish the agent. The deviation from the principal's interest by the agent is called "agency costs".

## Model
The model states that some relationships comprises a principal who hires an agent to fulfill a contractual promise.

The principal's interests are expected to be pursued by the agent however, when their interests differ, a dilemma arises. 

1. The agent possesses resources such as time, information and expertise that the principal lacks. 
2. The principal does not have entire control over the agent's ability to act in his best interests. 

## Assertion
In this situation, the theory posits that the agent's activities are **diverted from following the principal's interests** and instead **drive him to maximize his personal advantage**. 
- e.g.  in case of a dual sequence of relationships, the citizens or voters count on the politicians that they elected to fulfill their duties by structuring a system in which their healthcare and financial safety is guaranteed. 
	- Each citizen is a cog in the society machine and if everyone was overlooking the functioning of each and every entity in the system, society would never develop. 
	- However, at the same time, the minister of health cannot be overlooking each and every operation being done at the internal level of each public entity, bureaucrats are in charge of running those institutions. 
	- However when the seed of corruption is planted, the whole system is disrupted as the agent is no longer pursuing the interest of the principal. 

## Agency cost
An agency cost is an economic concept that refers to the costs associated with the relationship between a "principal" (an organization, person or group of persons), and an "agent". The agent is given powers to make decisions on behalf of the principal. 

However, the two parties may have different incentives and the agent generally has more information. The principal cannot directly ensure that its agent is always acting in its (the principal's) best interests. This potential divergence in interests is what gives rise to agency costs.

### Sources of cost
Professor Michael Jensen of the Harvard Business School and the late Professor William Meckling of the Simon School of Business, University of Rochester wrote an influential paper in 1976 titled "Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs and Ownership Structure". Professor Jensen also wrote an important paper with Eugene Fama of University of Chicago titled "Agency Problems and Residual Claims". These works categories agency costs into three main sources:

1. Costs borne by the principal to **mitigate the problems associated with using an agent**. 
	1. These costs are generally referred to as **monitoring costs**. They may include gathering more information on what the agent is doing 
		1. e.g., the costs of producing financial statements or carrying out audits) or employing mechanisms to align the interests of the agent with those of the principal 
		2. e.g. compensating executives with equity payment such as stock options
2. Costs borne by the agent to **build trust** with their principal. 
	1. These costs are referred to as **bonding costs**. 
	2. Bonding costs may include 
		1. contractually limiting the agent's decision making powers, or 
		2. increasing the transparency of the agent's decision. 
	3. In theory, agents will only take on bonding costs where $$Marginal\;Benefit â‰¥ Marginal\;Cost_{Agent}$$
	4. Bonding costs may reduce the steps that a principal will need to take to monitor the agent. 
	5. Therefore, the agent's acceptance of these costs may produce a higher utility outcome for both parties. 
	6. In practice, bonding costs are nearly impossible to measure.
3. The costs that arise where the agent **acts contrary to the best interests of the principal**. 
	1. These are referred to as '**residual costs**'.
