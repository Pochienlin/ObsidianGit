## Overview
Honor killings are acts of violence, often murder, committed against individuals, typically women and girls, who are perceived to have brought shame or dishonor upon their family or community. Honor killings are often motivated by a desire to restore the perceived honor of the family or community, and are typically carried out by male family members. Honor killings are a serious human rights violation and are condemned by the international community.

Honor killings are a global issue and have been reported in a number of countries around the world, including Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, and Jordan. These countries have traditionally had high rates of honor killings, and continue to face significant challenges in addressing and combating the issue.
