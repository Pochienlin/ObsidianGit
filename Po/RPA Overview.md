## Intro to RPA
> [!abstract]
> Robotic Process Automation, or RPA for short, is the technology that enables a software program to mimic human actions while interacting with computer applications to accomplish required tasks. 

Some human interactions that can be automated our keyboard inputs, mouse movements, and clicks and reading data from the computer screen. With automation software, robots can do these tasks. 

##### RPA makes it easy to build, deploy and manage software robots that emulate human actions interacting with digital systems and software. 
- Just like people Software, Robots can do things like understand what's on a screen, complete the right key strokes, navigate systems, identify and extract data, and perform a wide range of defined actions. But software Robots can do it faster and more consistently than people without the need to get up and stretch or take a coffee break. 
- RPA is finding utility across industries and is being massively adopted by organizations globally. 
	- It is not just disrupting IT, it is also altering the composition of work. The advantages of RPA have uniquely positioned it to be increasingly integrated with the way people work, thereby changing it. 
	- Some of the salient aspects of RPA causing the shift are, that with RPA you can develop software robots that can mimic human actions. It can be accomplished in a low code environment. 
	- You don't need programming knowledge to create basic automation using UI path. It can make operations more efficient. 
		- For example, a robot can execute tasks assigned to it much faster compared to a human. 

##### RPA can help workers become more productive
- release their bandwidth to focus on other aspects of their work. 
- They can consequently focus on tasks that involve creativity and human decisions. 

##### It reads and processes data in a **structured form** from various applications. 
- For example, it can extract information from PDF, Word, Excel documents and process it as per the requirement.
- It operates on **different computer applications**, for example, Browser, Excel etc. 
- It is non-invasive and can access applications like CRM, Microsoft Office applications, browsers etc, to perform repetitive tasks. It is easy to implement and powerful to scale as per the requirement. The number of robots can be increased or decreased depending upon the requirement. 

##### RPA solutions can be easily developed and deployed. 
- It works 24/7 without making errors as it works on predefined rules. 
- The robots can work continuously without taking a break. 
- As the rules for the robots are predefined, it also increases their accuracy. 
- RPA as a technology creates a digital robotic workforce that performs manual operations for completing a task. 


## Benefits of RPA
### 1. increased execution speed. 
1. RPA robots are faster and efficient compared to human operators.
2. Smoother and faster operations and improved productivity. 
### 2. reduced cost of process execution. 
1. As the robots are efficient and faster, they lead to optimal utilization of resources, 
	- lower cost of process execution. 
### 1. improved accuracy. 
1. Robots are not prone to human errors. 
2. Humans are susceptible to errors and lack of precision.
RPA deployment ensures that the processes and decisions adhere to predefined rules, eliminating the chances of errors. 
### 4. easier scaling. 
1. Adaptive RPA solutions by scaling the solution resources up or down based on requirements. 
2. Robotic work force can be increased or decreased swiftly with zero or low cost while maintaining job quality consistency. 
### 5. improved compliance and governance. 
1. Robots adhere to the defined process
	1. better compliance and governance. 
2. Robots' log in details are unique and secure. 
3. Activities are controlled and supervised
	1. more transparent and compliant operations. 
### 6. rapid ROI. 
- cost reduction, 
- improved accuracy
- time and resource optimization, yielding a higher and faster ROI


### Industries best suited for RPA
#### Banking and finance
- retail credit assessment, fraud prevention,Â  account settlement, and payment clearance
- Improved levels of compliance at low costs.Â 
- better operational efficiency and analytical insights.Â  

#### Insurance.Â  Robots' quick processing of tasksÂ 
claims management process,Â  
-  lower operational costs.
	- get better customer insights and analysis.Â 

#### Health care
- patient management to claimÂ settlement 
- billing 
- patient discharge processes 

#### Manufacturing.
- facilitatesÂ reporting and administrative tasks.Â 
- bills of materials,Â front office experience, back-office operations, etc.Â 
- Improve productivity,Â meet customer expectations, and consistentlyÂ drive product innovation while reducing costs.Â 

#### Customer service.Â 
- one of the earliest adoptions of RPA.Â 
- Chatbots,Â 
- voice assistant devices,
- automated call centers,Â 

#### Travel, transportation and logistics industryÂ 
- customized featuresÂ while planning their travel,Â 
- specific humidities, interests,Â city transport, local bookings, etc.Â 


### Business Units best suited for RPA
- HR
- Sales
- Ops
- Info systems
- Supply chain
- Finance and accounting


### Attributes of Process best-suited for RPA
1. Rule-based, consistent processes
2. High volume transactions
3. Data-intensive, requiring data manipulation and number crunching
4. Manual and repetitive tasks
5. Process driven by digital inputs and receive data through digital files
#### Examples of Business Processes suitable for Automation
- Customer/ Vendor onboarding 
- Material master management (creating/updating) 
- Sales order creation 
- Invoice processing 
- Payment allocation 
- Purchase order processing 
- Order fulfillment 
- Bank reconciliation 
- Cash allocation and reporting All these processes exhibit some or all the features of processes suitable for automation and can be automated using RPA.
