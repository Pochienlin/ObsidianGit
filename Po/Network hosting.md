## Loopback address

`127.0.0.1` is the standard IP address referring to the current host

- If a program tries to connect to `127.0.0.1`, it is immediately looped back to the machine that currently runs the program
- Usually used for testing purposes, where you do not have another machine for conducting the test
- We may use this address in some labs in this course
- This is also called localhost

Ports are used to identify a particular process/application running on a machine so that the data sent to the machine can be relayed to the right application

- It is often present in some header of a network data packet; but can be omitted if using the standard ones
- E.g., [http://google.com:80](http://google.com/)
