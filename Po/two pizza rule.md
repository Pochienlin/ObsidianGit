## Brief
The 2 pizza rule is a guideline for deciding how many attendees should be invited to a meeting. According to the rule, every meeting should be small enough that attendees could be fed with two large pizzas.

## Goals
An important goal of the 2 pizza rule is to prevent groupthink, a phenomenon that occurs when a large group's need for consensus overrides the judgment of individual group members. The rule also discourages HiPPO, an acronym that stands for the "highest paid person's opinion" or the "highest paid person in the office." [HiPPO](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/HiPPOs-highest-paid-persons-opinions) describes the tendency for lower-paid employees to defer to higher-paid employees when a decision has to be made.

## Etymology
The 2 pizza rule is often credited to Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon. Bezos is known to have used 'two pizza' meetings and small project teams to foster a decentralized, creative working environment when Amazon was a startup.
