## ## Network Address Translation (NAT)

Map one network address (e.g., an IP and a port number) to another by modifying the address information in network communication data

- So that, data can be (re)routed by the network to a different receiver or can appear to come from a different sender.
- E.g., the router at our home 192.168.0.1
