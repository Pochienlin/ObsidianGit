## [[Inverted Pyramid Structure]]
- Headlines and lead paragraphs should be informative, succint and interesting
- Conveys information to the reader quickly 
- Allows reader to move through the story easily
##### Evaluating value:
- Timeliness, impact, relevance, peculiarity, currency, human interest etc

## Writing the story
1. Writing lead paragraph
	1.  Interest the reader with the most important information
	2. 5W1H: Why and how are usually explained later, might put them into subsequent paragraphs instead
	3. Quick and accurate conveyance of information
	4. Do not crowd the reader with information
2. Developing the story
	1. Lead informs reader and raises question. Second paragraph and beyond answer these questions by providing additional information
> [!question] Ask yourself
> What will the reader want to know next?

## Ending the story
- Do not need a conclusion paragraph
- ensure all logical loose ends are tied
- Ensure readers are satisfied with the discussion

## Transition
- Tie info together
- Guide readers on what might come next
- Use:
	- Connectors
	- Associations
	- Chonology
	- Enumeration
## Quotations
Gives voice to the interviewees

> [!warning]
> Does a profile piece make for an exception?
- Direct quotes
	- Use sparingly 
		- Use when strong emotion is demonstrated
		- Powerful anecdotes that we don't want to paraphrase
	- Bounded by quotation marks, state exact words of interviewees
- Indirect quotes
	- Paraphrase interviewee's words more efficiently
		- When information is factual and dry
			- E.g. when the event started, how many people showed up, who organised this etc

## Central theme/ Angle
- dictates the headlines
### Headlines
- [ ] Clear and specific
- [ ] Tells the reader what the story is about 
- [ ] draws the reader in 
- [ ] 5-10 words max
- [ ] Should contain subject, verb, object
- [ ] Should not repeat words in the lead paragraph 
	- If we do, it can appear that we are running out of words
- [ ] Use present-tense
	- Even for past events
- [ ] For future events, use "to..." instead of "will"
- [ ] Do not use articles
- [ ] Avoid abbreviations, unless very well known
	- e.g. HDB, MOM, PUB for a Singaporean audience is ok
- [ ] Direct quotes in headlines should be replaced with colon
