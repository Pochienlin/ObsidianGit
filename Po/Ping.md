Ping is a tool used to test whether a particular host/machine is reachable across a network

- The program sends packets to the target host and listens for reply from the target
- In labs, you may need to use ping to troubleshoot, to see if a remote machine can be reached
- Example
    - ping [google.com](http://google.com/)
    - ping 10.10.15.17
