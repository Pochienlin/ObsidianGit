> A business must define the recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO).

## RTO: How far back?
> RTO - maximum agreed acceptable period of time following a service disruption that can elapse before business functions are severely impacted.
> 

## RPO: How long to recover?
> RPO - the point to which information used by a business activity must be restored to enable the activity to operate on resumption of the service.

    - The database is restored from the last backup
    - Is the RTO met and the RPO met?
        - Yes, both are

## Problems and risk
- It is good practice to assess high risk areas for any underlying problems.
- From the previous example: ‚Äú*Customer can‚Äôt log a claim*‚Äù has low likelihood but extreme business impact.
- All possible failure modes can be examined for any underlying problems e.g. the network router is old and has no redundancy.
