Big data is a term for data sets that are so large or complex that traditional data processing applications are inadequate to deal with them.
- **Dictionary:** They are extremely large data sets that may be analyzed computationally to reveal patterns, trends, and associations, especially relating to human behavior and interactions.
- **Wikipedia**: Big data is a field that treats ways to analyze, systematically extract information from, or otherwise deal with data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software.

## Domain
Big data challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy and data source.

[[ 5Vs (Big Data)]]
