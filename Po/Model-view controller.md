## 
**Modelâ€“viewâ€“controller** (**MVC**) is a [[software design pattern]] commonly used for developing [[user interfaces]]that divide the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user.

Traditionally used for desktop [[graphical user interfaces]] (GUIs), this pattern became popular for designing [[web applications]]. Popular programming languages have MVC frameworks that facilitate implementation of the pattern.
