# Overview
The Data Manipulation in RPA course offers a deep understanding of Data Manipulation techniques used in Studio to build automation projects. The course assumes that the student has completed course 1 of this specialization. The student undergoing this course shall learn about different types of Variables and Arguments in Studio and their usage. The learner will also gain in-depth knowledge about Data Manipulation and its importance in building simple to complex automation projects. 

The course is self-paced and has a mix of theory lectures, practice exercises, and an associated graded quiz.

This is the second course of [[Robotic Process Automation]] (RPA) Specialization by UiPath. RPA specialization equips the student with basic automation skills to launch a career in RPA. Upon successful completion of the specialization, the student will develop the ability to design & develop automation projects independently. The student will be ready to become a Junior RPA Developer and have the necessary skills & knowledge to pass UiPath RPA Associate - UiRPA. 

# Audience
This course is intended for industry professionals and students who want to design and develop automation projects for process automation.

Student/Learner Pre-requisites
To understand and complete the course successfully, the student should have completed course 1 of this specialization. 

# Course Outline
The course consists of five modules: 
- [[UiPath Introduction to Variables]]
- [[UiPath Introduction to Arguments]]
- [[UiPath Data Manipulation and its importance]]
- [[UiPath String and DataTable Manipulation]]
- [[UiPath Collection, Its Types and Manipulations ]]

The material of this course and upcoming courses in the specialization consists of video lessons, practice exercises, reading material, and graded assessment. 

## Video Lessons
The video lessons of the course are divided into four modules. Each lesson equips the students with the skills and knowledge which prepares them for the subsequent lessons. The video lessons are of two types:
1. Theory explanation: The theory explanation videos will provide knowledge on specific concepts used to build automation projects
2. Demonstration: The demonstration videos will show the practical application of the concepts. You are encouraged to re-create the steps explained in the video to understand the concept presented entirely. 

It is highly recommended that you follow the lessons in chronological order. 

# Practice Exercises
The practice exercise of the course helps you practice concepts that you learn in the video lessons. A solution document accompanies each practice exercise. The solution document contains the process overview and step-by-step instructions, which incrementally reveal the solution and make it easier for the student to create the workflows. It is recommended that you try and practice the exercise independently before taking assistance from the solution document.

# Reading Material
Reading material provides supplementary knowledge to core topics that are critical to developing RPA Developer skills. You are encouraged to read the reading material in its entirety.

# Graded Quiz
At the end of the course, you will encounter a graded quiz that will test your understanding of the course. 

## How to use the course assets

- You should follow UiPath recommendations on course assets usage for the best learning experience.
- You should use the video lessons to understand the concepts. Please pause the video and replay it till you develop a complete understanding of the concept.
- You should use the practice exercises to test your learning of the concepts. 
- You should read the problem statement of the practice exercise and come up with working solutions.
- The solution document provided with each practice exercise is one of the many possible solutions. You should try and come up with the most optimum solution.
- If you cannot solve the problem, you can refer to the process overview provided as hints to design the solution.
- If you can still not solve the problem, you should go through the step-by-step instructions to design the solution.
