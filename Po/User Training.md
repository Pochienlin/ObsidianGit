## Why user training?
Many types of users need training.

Categories of user include administrators, operators, support and end users. They need to know:

- What IT systems they need to use.
- What functions to use in the systems.
- How the systems are used in the business process.
- For support users also need to know:
    - Change procedures
    - Backup and recovery
    - Incident and problem resolution.
