## Similar terms for data

- Data, information, message, content, and value are mostly treated as synonyms in this course, although they have subtle differences.

##### Data
- Most general among the terms; it refers to any symbols or signs of something (e.g., a situation, person, company, product, account, etc.), whether understandable or not.

##### Information
- Understandable data about facts or details of something.

##### Message
- Data that is usually stored in transient memory (in contrast to persistent files, databases, external storages, etc.)

##### Content
- Information that is more relevant to a specific business scenario
- E.g., the content of a message may refer to the business information and networking information in the message

##### Value
- An actual piece of information about a particular fact or detail
- E.g., an argument value in a function call
- Sample Data/Message â€” JSON
    ```python
    {
      "orders": [
        {
          "customer_id": "Apple TAN", 
          "order_id": 5, 
          "order_item": [
            {
              "book_id": "9781434474234", 
              "item_id": 3, 
              "order_id": 5, 
              "quantity": 1
            }, 
            {
              "book_id": "9781449474212", 
              "item_id": 2, 
              "order_id": 5, 
              "quantity": 1
            }, 
            â€¦
          ], 
          "timestamp": "Wed, 14 Nov 2018 22:42:31 GMT"
        },
        â€¦
    ```
    
    For this sample...
    
    - **Data**: is about the JSON data; can be a JSON file (usually in harddisk) or a JSON message (usually in memory);
    - **Information**: is about a JSON object containing a key/name-value pair ("orders" is the name/key; the value is an array of other key/name-value pairsâ€¦);
    - **Content**: is about a list of orders, likely for a book ordering scenario;
    - **Value**: is about the specific values in the orders, e.g., "Apple TAN" is a value; "9781434474234" is another value; â€¦
    - For communications, sending data/information/message/content/value/file/etc. are all possible, depending on the traditions for describing particular scenarios or contexts and how much specific details the description is intended to provide.
