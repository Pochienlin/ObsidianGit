### Business participant
The participants in the workflows can be

1. **Roles** (supervisor, manager),
2. **Departments** (finance, sales),
3. **Systems** (service center system, order entry system)
- The participants are chosen only if they are performing an activity.
- Business participants will be allocated a swimlane if they perform an activity

### Activity
is a task performed by a participant

Three types of activities can be considered from the automation perspective
1. **Manual activities** are activities performed by **human effort**, **unaided by systems**, for example, â€œPack Goodsâ€œ. Such activities should be shown in the swim-lane of the human/role
2. **Interactive activities** are activities done by **humans that involve usage of systems**, for example, "Enter Orderâ€œ. Such activities should be shown in the swim-lane of the human/role using the system
3. **Automated activities** are activities done by **systems with no manual involvement**, for example, "Retrieve Ordersâ€œ. Such activities should be shown in the swim-lane of the system

Captures sequence of activities and provides the process flow view
