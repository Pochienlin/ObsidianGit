## Authoritative DNS server

Put simply, an authoritative DNS server is a server that actually holds, and is responsible for, DNS resource records. This is the server at the bottom of the DNS lookup chain that will respond with the queried resource record, ultimately allowing the web browser making the request to reach the IP address needed to access a website or other web resources. An authoritative nameserver can satisfy queries from its own data without needing to query another source, as it is the final source of truth for certain DNS records.

Itâ€™s worth mentioning that in instances where the query is for a subdomain such as foo.example.com orÂ [blog.cloudflare.com](https://blog.cloudflare.com/), an additional nameserver will be added to the sequence after the authoritative nameserver, which is responsible for storing the subdomainâ€™sÂ [CNAME record](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-cname-record/).

There is a key difference between many DNS services and the one that Cloudflare provides. Different DNS recursive resolvers such as Google DNS, OpenDNS, and providers like Comcast all maintain data center installations of DNS recursive resolvers. These resolvers allow for quick and easy queries through optimized clusters of DNS-optimized computer systems, but they are fundamentally different than the nameservers hosted by Cloudflare.

Cloudflare maintains infrastructure-level nameservers that are integral to the functioning of the Internet. One key example is theÂ [f-root server network](https://blog.cloudflare.com/f-root/)Â which Cloudflare is partially responsible for hosting. The F-root is one of the root level DNS nameserver infrastructure components responsible for the billions of Internet requests per day. OurÂ [Anycast network](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/anycast-network/)Â puts us in a unique position to handle large volumes of DNS traffic without service interruption.
