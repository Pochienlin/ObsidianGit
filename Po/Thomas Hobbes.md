# Natural Conditions of Mankind

> “…whatsoever is the object of any man’s appetite or desire, that is it which he for his part calls good; and the object of his hate and aversion, evil … There being nothing simply and absolutely so; nor any common rule of good and evil to be taken from the nature of the objects themselves.” (The Leviathan, p.32)
> 

> “I put for a general inclination of all mankind, a perpetual and restless desire for power that ceases only in death. And the cause of this is not always that a man … cannot be content with a moderate power: but because he cannot assure the power and the mans to live well, which he has present without the acquisition of more” (The Leviathan, p. 55-6)
> 

- **Methodological individualism**: natural a-sociability
- Natural liberty and the natural right to self-preservation
- **Negative liberty**: freedom from external impediments
- **Natural equality**: equality faculties and expectations
- **Human reason**: instrumental, calculating, prudential
- **Mechanistic conception**: men as atoms in motion
- **Natural liberty and equality** = unhindered pursuit of self-interest
- **Amorality vs. immorality**: “Passions of a Man are in themselves no Sin”
- Subjective and plural definitions of good/evil
- “**Natural right to everything**”: collision course; war of all against all
- No common power = no law = no property = no injury = no injustice

> “In such condition there is no place for industry, because the fruit thereof is uncertain, and consequently no culture of the earth, no navigation nor the use of commodities that may be imported by sea, no commodious building, no instruments of moving and removing such things as require much force, no knowledge of the face of the earth, no account of time, no arts, no letters, no society, and which is worst of all, continual fear and danger of violent death, and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.”
> 
- First law of nature discovered: seek peace (prudence vs. injunction)
- Main motive: fear of death, desire for comfortable living
- Demotion of politics: good life to mere life
- First covenant: renouncing the right to everything
- Objective framework of rules of pursuing self-interest
- Covenants with swords: restraint on human behaviour

# The Leviathan

- A new political problem: behaviour vs. virtue
- **Ordering motion**: reconciling mobility & self-interest with stability and authority
- A new form of **authority and subjectivity**: the bourgeois state and the private citizen
- A new **purpose of political existence**: public order, safety, security, comfort
- A new **code of citizenship**: law-abiding, productive, obedient, *private*

- Political society born of *consent*: made, not given
- Transfer of powers to (1) define right/wrong, (2) coercion
- “Authorising” public power: exclusion of private judgments & discretion
- Sovereignty: source of legal jurisdiction; supreme; territorial; indivisible; inalienable
- The state: artificial persona, “mortal god”
- Legal positivism: legality = justice
- Will and command vs. reason, truth, and learning
- Natural law ¹ law proper
- Legal order (law as such) > specific laws
- Laws as restraint
- *The Leviathan*: modern but not liberal
- Absolute, unlimited, unaccountable power of the state
- Right to taxation, confiscation, conscription
- Impermissibility of retracting consent
- The Commonwealth as the lesser evil

Next week: Locke’s innovation on Hobbes → liberalism

## Threshold of the modern

- Epistemology: sense perception; physics; mechanics
- Methodology: individualism; natural freedom and equality
- Ontology: mere life; peace and comfortable living
- Political problem: ordering motion
- Source of legitimacy: authority from the consent of the governed
- Conception of justice: legal positivism

Why is War naturally occurring?

- There is no central conception of right or wrong if natural equality exists (meaning all views are equally valid; then what is right or wrong or what is the basis of right or wrong?) This creates insecurity.

How can War be avoided?
