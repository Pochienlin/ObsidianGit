Main article: [DMAIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMAIC "DMAIC")

The DMAIC project methodology has five phases:
-   _**D**efine_ the system, the voice of the customer and their requirements, and the project goals, specifically.
-   _**M**easure_ key aspects of the current process and collect relevant data; calculate the "as-is" process capability
-   _**A**nalyze_ the data to investigate and verify cause and effect. Determine what the relationships are, and attempt to ensure that all factors have been considered. Seek out the root cause of the defect under investigation.
-   _**I**mprove_ or optimize the current process based upon data analysis using techniques such as [design of experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_of_experiments "Design of experiments"), [poka yoke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poka_yoke "Poka yoke") or mistake proofing, and standard work to create a new, future state process. Set up pilot runs to establish [process capability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_capability "Process capability").
-   _**C**ontrol_ the future state process to ensure that any deviations from the target are corrected before they result in defects. Implement [control systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_systems "Control systems") such as [statistical process control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_process_control "Statistical process control"), production boards, visual workplaces, and continuously monitor the process. This process is repeated until the desired quality level is obtained.

Some organizations add a _**R**ecognize_ step at the beginning, which is to recognize the right problem to work on, thus yielding an RDMAIC methodology.


## Define:

- Understand the needs
- Voice of Customer (VoC), Business (VoB), Employee (VoE)
- Critical success factors = Critical To Quality (CTQs)

## Measure:

- Qualitative - Feelings e.g. survey; opinions e.g. interview
- Quantitative - Time e.g. processing, No. of errors = defects

## Analyse:

- Ensure quality is being met/improved
- Discover trends - Improving or Worsening

## Control:

- A process is only high quality if it is in control.
- Have a response strategy for falling quality
- Continuously improve quality.
