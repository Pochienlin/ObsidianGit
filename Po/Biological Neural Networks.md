## Neurons and Neural Network
- All algorithms used in deep learning are inspired by the way neurons and neural networks process data in the brain 
- Santiago Ramon y Cajal was the first to draw a neuron based on what he saw under a microscope 
- A neuron has a body (soma) with long arms (dendrites) that branch off to connect with other neurons

- Dendrites receive electrical impulses carrying data from sensors or terminal buttons of other neurons - In the nucleus, electrical impulses are processed by combining them together and then passed on to the axon 
- Learning occurs by repeatedly activating certain neural connections and reinforcing them 
- Artificial neurons behave in same way as biological neurons, with a soma, dendrites, and axon - Learning process resembles way learning occurs in the brain
