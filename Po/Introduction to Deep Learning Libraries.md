---
There are several popular deep learning libraries and frameworks, including TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and Theano. 

## TensorFlow
TensorFlow is the most popular and is used in the production of deep learning models. It was developed by Google and released in 2015. 

## PyTorch
PyTorch is a derivative of the Torch framework in Lua and is used for machine learning algorithms running on GPUs. It was rewritten and tailored to be fast and native to Python, and has gained popularity in academic research and applications of deep learning requiring custom expressions. 

## Keras
Keras is a high level API for building deep learning models and is known for its ease of use and simplicity. It can be used with a low-level library such as TensorFlow and is supported by Google. 

## Comparing the Libraries

1. Keras is good for quickly building deep learning models
2. PyTorch and TensorFlow offer more control and the ability to closely monitor the network over time. 

The decision of which library to use will depend on personal preference.
